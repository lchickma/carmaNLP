1,Px53v36-brqre4,"Oh . With regard to , uh , adapting to a complex environment of work , I personally have Worked in some very complex environments . For example , I worked at Paris , France where I was , uh , forced to speak French . I had to learn how to speak French . I taught myself how to speak fluent French when I was living in Paris . I spent multiple years living in Paris and I was actually working on the stock market . Uh , FinTech , financial technology environment , a software developer , software engineer . So I've lived in Paris , also lived in London many years , five years of living in London . I've lived all over the world . I've been all over the world . Talk about complex environments . I mean , I've flown all over the wall and had to catch so many different planes flying to so many different locations , learning how to speak multiple different languages , spend a lot of time in Germany . I traveled over Eastern Europe , Greece , Italy , Spain , all over Northern Europe , Scotland , Wales , Ireland , Belgium , Netherlands , Luxembourg , France , obviously mentioned before . Switzerland , Austria , Poland , Czech Republic , also bend Australia and all over America in every state except for Alaska , Maine , and North Dakota . So I spent multiple years living on the Hawaiian islands as well . Uh , I'm in California now , but , uh , so I've been everywhere I've been , it's been so many places on this planet . Learn how to speak so many different languages . Have a graduate degree in science , hard science field . I've done so many things that most people don't ever do . So complex environments . I've been in many different complex environments and have to deal with some complex situations that your average individual , your average person off the street would have a very hard time managing . Uh , but I was successful in pretty much all of my endeavors I've ever done in my entire life . Obviously . Uh , all the different places I've been , all the things I've done , I did that on my own without any real help from anyone paid for those trips , myself , paid builders , different places . I've worked much muddle all my life . So yeah , complex environments , that's a , those are some complex environments I've had to work in . Speaking French on one phone programming software while you're speaking multiple different languages . Speaking of English on the other phone , it's hard .","Uh , in terms of the projects that I worked on , uh , I had a , uh , project , uh , that was very hard to achieve in terms of the technology that we were implementing . So I had to analyze a number of different technical libraries , different software libraries and different languages , primarily working with Java , Java script , a few different niches like that . Uh , so we had to analyze these different languages , analyze these different technologies that were available , these different libraries , and also try to figure out the least expensive technology that had the least cost in terms of licensing fees . So analyzing all those different technologies . Personally , I , I tried to push for open source technologies , uh , ones that are , uh , obviously robust though there's a lot of open source technologies . You , it'll have to test it . You need to be able to use them . But , uh , the ones that are bus things like Linux that have been around for decades , that are used by every major , uh , corporation for running the servers , those technologies , open source technologies like that , that's , you know , that kind of thing . It's just , it's a no brainer in terms of , uh , you're implementing an opensource technology . You want it to be robust , you want to test it out , you have to have a long history used by multiple different high level organizations that you want there to be good documentation of the technology . A lot of open source technologies , they get rulings and the documentation is terrible , but there's hardly any functions . Nobody defied the function does , there's no documentation for it . And you know , sometimes the open source technology gets abandoned and then you don't have , you don't have support cause whoever was working on it , they gave up on it and no one else took it over . Someone else started maintaining the code repository and then debated really , you know , do much work on it . So it's been stuck in an unsupported state for over a decade next to the kind of thing you want to avoid . So it can be open . Technology can be really good , but they can also be a pain in the butt if you're having to deal with , uh , undocumented technologies . Technology doesn't have the usage history that you need to be able to ascertain that technology properly functioning problems you're trying to solve .","Uh , one , one situation I've been dealing with recently is , uh , trying to procure , uh , computer parts , uh , for my organization . Uh , it's been , I don't know if many people are aware of this , but there's been a shortage , uh , uh , computer parts for a while now . Uh , coven was the reason why people are , they're justified the shortages , but I don't , that's , I think that , uh , corporations are taking advantage of that excuse to increase prices . And so , uh , you have this problem where technologies that , you know , computer parts that were very reasonably priced just a short while ago , just a few years ago and had been reasonably priced up until , you know , just a year and a half ago or so , they were suddenly being sold for much higher prices . And that makes it difficult to me . And in the area of the industry that I work in , computer science industry , if you're , if your computer parts are suddenly being sold for much higher prices , that makes everything more difficult . You need multiple computers . A good programmer and good software developer and software engineer is working on multiple screens . They might have multiple operating systems that they're running on multiple different computers of , because you want , you know , you want to be able to test a software and multiple different , do you have a cross platform piece of software ? You want to be able to test that on multiple different systems . You might have a window system , might have a windows 10 system , you might have a windows 11 system . You're not having a windows Vista system . If you're supporting older operating systems , you might have a Linux system , you might have multiple districts of Linux that you want to support . You might have an OSX and Macintosh Mac OSX system . So you want to test out all those different systems . I might have multiple different tablets . You might have an iPad , an Android tablet , you might have an Android . Pardon me , I have an iPhone . You want to test on all those different platforms , but the cost is prohibited . So you have to make rapid decisions in terms of where you're going to cure those technological devices . And you have to analyze tons of different data in terms of recent market prices , uh , vendors , whether these renters are reliable , whether the products have warranties , whether the , how long the warranties are for , whether or not they support their warranty properly , whether or not a can return an item , if there's a problem .","Pretty much my entire life has been filled with high pressure , stressful situations who both work in smoke . Like I uh , explained earlier , I've lived all over the world and I spent many , many years living in multiple different places , on multiple different continent , speaking multiple languages and all those are stressful situations because when you land on another , in another nation speaking another language , you have to deal with all sorts of things . You have to deal with getting somewhere to live , you have to deal with uh , going to the grocery store drug dealing with these different situations in the language that you don't speak that well probably . So that's a stressful situation . And then you're working , you're working in the place where you're going to be dealing with multiple different languages . So you're speaking to one individual in English , speaking to another individual and French speaking to another individual in German that can be stressful . It's difficult for the mind to switch between multiple different languages . And especially if your desire , I'm a software engineer . I have to also deal with computer languages in addition to human language inside the switch between humans speaking in multiple different languages . Then I get on a computer and speaking another language to the computer , speaking in Java , speaking with JavaScript , speaking in C plus plus all these different languages . Python just being forced to switch my brain . We did multiple different languages in English , ribs , uh , Java , JavaScript , parking lot , whatever . I'm switching between these different languages . That is , that's stressful . That's stressful . Especially when I've worked on the stock market , financial technology . So that's a stressful high pressure environment because you're dealing with brokers and traders who are all kind of very high , high , strong individuals . Uh , cause you know , they're dealing with prices on stocks that are going up by 20% one day , dropping by 20% the next day or they're dealing with billions of dollars that have been lost or they , you know , that money is being produced or being lost and pay me on where the stock goes . That's a very high stressful , A lot of people Can't handle that level of stress , but I've been able to , uh , live all over the world , literally all over the United States as well . In addition to the time of spending in the United States and multiple different nations also went from multiple different parts of the United States , obviously , uh , Hawaiian islands . I live in Wynonna , so that was pretty cool for many years . Living in California for many years at some pretty nice places .","One thing I am very strict on myself about is that I have to , uh , make , I have to honor any commitments that I make . So if I say I'm going to do something , I do it . And this is something that I stick to in every aspect of my life of work and personal relationships with my girlfriends , with my ex wife , different relationships I've had , uh , when we were married obviously . But , uh , and I , I'm very strict with myself . If I said I'm going to do something , I honor that commitment . Very , uh , Moyle and very honorable in terms of how I , if I make a promise to anyone , maybe a friend , old friend , spouse , I'm going to honor that commitment . That's something that you don't find a lot of nowadays . There's many people who say they're going to do something and they're just forget about it . But I'm not like that . Even if my 99.99 , nine , 9% of the wrestle , that modern world is like that , I'm not going to be like that . So it's , that's it . It's hard though because it's , you have to be very careful about the promises you make cause you want to make sure that you're able to follow through on them . So if I , if I'm in a work situation , any one situation , no matter what it is , if I say no , this project is going to be done three months , we're going to go with this project for three months , then I'm ready . I do every , every single thing possible to make sure that we meet that deadline . And , uh , I , I'm always willing to put in extra hours the amount of work that I do . I mean , I've worked at so many different jobs where I've worked a hundred plus hours a week . So that's , you know , a couple hours of sleep a night . That's not much sleep . You're working on the weekends , you're working every Saturday , every Sunday for so many years . I've also worked on Christmas day , great steering day , 4th of July , every holiday that everyone else has all , I never get myself off of the court . So in terms of honoring commitments , keeping difficult commitments , right ? I would be a top 1% of people on the planet on commitments and willing to put in the extra work , necessary project done . So that's pretty , uh , pretty rare that I do that .",1.333333333,2.8,2,3,2.666666667
2,Pchzj9s-d68a4p,"Hey , a ton of work . When we had to adapt to a changing and complex environment . As I previously mentioned , I was a project manager in a large technical initiative where we had a major deliverable across a several year period and I had a large cross functional team that I was leading . Uh , as we finished our first year and as we got into October , we'll both our plan for the second year and we built that plan based on an assumption of what our funding would be for that second year . However , we found out later in the month of October that our budget was only going to be about 75% of what we had originally allocated . As you can imagine , immediately , this caused a lot of concern within the project team and I knew that we would need to adapt in order to refocus and make sure that we could go into the next year or the good flooding . So what I did is sat the team down . We walked through it in a very logical manner . And what I looked through 15 is we identified all the things that we were willing to spend money on in that second year . And we basically prioritized them from the highest priority all the way down to the lowest priority . And once we have that list and once we agreed to it , we then went down the list and we identified where the cutoff was based on our new funding level of seven , 5% and we were able to do that . We then drew a line in the set , all the things above the line will be the things that we'll continue to walk on over things below the line . We'll pull out of our plan and we'll defer them to a later year . So once he did that , we were able to redo the plan . We were able to come up with , uh , an adjusted approach and we were able to , to change and adapt based on what a funding level was . So that was our plan . We went into the second year , you know , in a good situation with a plan can deliver on and rebel to make the adjustment based on the situation within the company . At the time .","There was a time where I said both for a project that I knew was going to be very difficult to achieve . As I mentioned , I had a large project that spanned across a number of years . When I was initially assigned to that project , I had not had any experience working in that particular technology field . I obviously had been a project manager , but I didn't necessarily know the technical details . I didn't know all the technical terminology and so I knew it was going to be very hard given how large this project was , how complex it was , and I knew that I was really going to have to act a little bit differently then how I worked out a traditional project that I stepped into . So in this case what I did is I started sitting down with each of the technical subject matter experts and just started asking a lot of questions about the technology , asking questions about their loans and really just going through a process of a lot of due diligence , a process of really trying to become more knowledgeable . And I think more importantly , just building the trust that these people could see that I truly was interested . I was engaged . I was committed to learning and understanding the job and roles that they did . And so by taking that approach , I was able to come in . I was able to establish myself in that project leadership role as the project manager . And more importantly is I was then able to begin to communicate with them in a way where we could build a plan because that initial plan was so critical for them building all of our future deliverables on . So by taking this somewhat different approach at the beginning of this project , I was much less successful than if I had just stepped in there and probably followed a more traditional approach .","They had a situation several years ago , our project team needed to make an important , uh , decision that , um , had time implications in , was going to impact whether we could meet our deliverable . Um , but we had conflicting information about which decision to make . And so when an issue came up , what I decided was really let's bring all the right stakeholders to the table and let me facilitate the discussion . And by doing they're bringing their ex expertise , bring in their knowledge and make sure that we talk to each other so that we , we don't necessarily talk past each other , which I think was part of the root cause of the issue . And so , uh , after we identified that we have this issue , after we acknowledge what the implications would be if mr . Timelines , I scheduled a special meeting , we all sat down together , we laid out very clearly what the two options were . I had each to talk through what that option was in their , uh , perspective . And I made sure that we didn't miss certainly news of specific language or jargon that might not necessarily be understandable to the other party . So we tried to make it very simple , very streamlined . And at that point , as we talked through the two options , I think there was some realization between the teams about why one option was going to be more successful , would allow us to hold to our timeline . Whereas the other option was much higher risk and most likely was probably not going to be successful and would end up pushing us off our timeline even further . So by taking that action and getting everybody engaged and willing , sort of taking myself out of the middle , but being more of the facilitator , I was really able to drive that discussion , ensure that we were able to reach a solution .","They had a recent situation that was very high pressure , uh , and very stressful , uh , in my previous work assignment . And the way that we really overcame it was by stepping back in , looking at the bigger picture . So the situation was that I was needing a very large project and we needed to get all of our requirements done , um , by a certain timeframe so that we could hand them off and stay on track with our project timeline . The issue lies though that as we got to within about , probably within about 48 hours before the requirements were , do we realize that there was a big issue and then it was going to take a lot more work and the need to step back and we do some of the requirements . And so the way that I handled that is knowing I only had 48 hours . Um , what I did is I sat down with the team . I told them that we were gonna need to close some time off of our calendars and to make this really our top priority . And what I did is I went through the process with them . So rather than just giving them a task , sending them back and putting my limits , uh , pressure and stressful situation , what I did is I sat down with them , rolled up my sleeves , we sat down that next day . We worked through the requirements . We did them this time in the correct approach that was needed so that we could hand them off and continue to move forward in the project . And so when teams saw me engaging with them and working with them jointly to address this , uh , they , yes , they sensed it was a high pressure . Yes , they sense that there was a lot of stress , but at the same time , I think they felt that it was pressure and stress that we were under and that we were working together as a team to deliver the best outcome for the business . So that was the situation in terms of how I dealt with it . And I think at the end we had a very good outcome .","I had a situation at work where I was leading my , um , my major project team , but I had also taken on several , uh , parallel responsibilities and some of sort of smaller projects that I was also moving forward . And when my major project started , um , started evolving and adding a lot of incremental activities , all of a sudden I realized that I had a lot of commitments on my plate and that something was going to have to give and I didn't want to necessarily , um , decrease the quality of my work or my deliverables . And so I realized I was definitely going to need to reprioritize things and to defer a couple of the commitments I had made , um , so that I could do them in the best way possible . And so what I did , he has identified the commitments that I would need to defer , uh , reached out to the stakeholders that I had made the commitments to explain the situation to them . And I think they were very accommodating . They understood that , um , that these demands can be somewhat , um , evolving . And what I was able to do is to be negotiated with them . And to the revised state as to when we would address or when I would complete my part of the deliverable . Um , and based on that , we were able to update the schedule for the project and it was done in a way that will certainly have a major implication on their overall initiatives as well . So , uh , in essence , I would say it was more of a matter of just resetting expectations , using very clear , concise communication and making sure my , my stakeholders and I walked away being on the same page , um , and all agreeing that this was really in the best interest of the business .",3.666666667,3.333333333,3.333333333,3.333333333,3.333333333
3,Pa89y2t-ehqxx6,"Yeah , that's fine that I had to adapt to your changing or complex environment at work . So this happened to me in my previous role where I was initially working as an information analysts and then I was actually transitioned to a PM type of role . And so that work was new to me . So what I did to kind of adapt to this is , you know , I scheduled a lot of meetings with the other PMs to see , you know , their day to day work , how they did their scheduling , what processes that they found were most effective in their daily work . And then I would , you know , utilize those skills , uh , scheduling meetings with , uh , stakeholders , things like that , and make sure everyone is on the same schedule for the projects at hand . And I think just reaching out to others and getting their input really helped me to be a better PM , like from the get go .","So the time that I set goals for a project that were difficult to achieve , I would say in my previous role as PM , uh , one of the project we were working on was um , metadata tagging for a different course that we had working on in , in this project . We needed to work with a team overseas . And so there were , it was a lot of complex moving parts with that project for sure . So some things that I did as the PM once I schedule weekly meetings with them and make sure we were all on the same page for the project , scheduling weekly meetings with my team as well , the internal team to make sure they were all on the same page with the work . And then we worked to coordinate both teams . So we would also have emails including both teams and some meetings with both teams as well . So it was very complex , a lot of scheduling meetings to make sure everyone is on the same page as far as the workload . And then tracking both projects , tracking the time for both teams and to see where they were at . And if we fell behind schedule , you know , I would check in with either team to say , say , Hey , what can we do to speed up this process ? So overall , we finished the project well ahead of schedule and I think that wasn't hard because of making sure everyone was on the same page throughout the process .","So a situation where I needed to make an important decision quickly . So that happened to me in a previous role where we had been given a project and the level of complexity was way higher than we'd ever seen before . And the conflicting information was we'd only been given a set amount of hours to work on it . And what I was seeing was that to do a good job on it , we needed a lot more time . And so what I did was , you know , I talked to my boss about it and I showed him exactly what I was seeing and said for me to do a good job on this work , I'm going to need more time . And what we found was that I take taken longer on it and produce really good work and other people have cut corners and try to meet those timelines and their work wasn't as good and had to be redone often . So I'm pleased with my decision to reach out to my boss , and I think it all worked out well in the end that I needed to trust my instincts and do things how I thought I should .","Yeah . So I think a high pressure situation at work or in school for me , I would say it would be in school . While working on my master's degree , I needed to prepare a conference talk and it was very stressful for me because I had never presented my work to such a large audience before and an audience of experts too . So how I responded to it was I spoke with my advisor in my cohort and we had a lot of weekly meetings that we would do in general . And so we started to use that time , some of it for me to present my presentation to them to get feedback and then iterate on that every time we would meet . And I think that was incredibly helpful for me . It helped reduce my nerves and I was able to give his presentation and I felt really great about it . I got a lot of good feedback and it was very pleased with the outcome . And I think because I had done it so many times with Y , so I would definitely do that the same way again .","Yeah . I think , you know , experiencing difficulty , keeping a commitment at work . I think this is something that happens a lot . Honestly . I think that if you have conflicting projects and deadlines , this is really easy to happen . So what I would say is in these kinds of situations , I make sure that I'm always keeping track of my timeline and the things that are going on at the same time . And if I'm seeing the conflicting things start to come up , I would , you know , reach out to my boss and say , you know , I don't think I can do both of this , these things at once , you know , what do you think we should do moving forward ? I really reach out to others to see if there's any leeway in the scheduling . And if there's not , you know , maybe work longer hours on certain days . But I would try to keep both commitments as best as I could for sure .",3,2.666666667,2.666666667,3.333333333,2.333333333
4,Pry6pue-8vi6dg,"One of the things in my current job as a call center , we moved from hard phones to soft phones . It was a very , very complex change . As most of during the hard phone . Of course , your buttons are right in front of you . On the soft phone , it's a little bit more different . There's a down button you have to press and be able to mute calls , transfer , things of that nature . Um , so thankfully , uh , we got together , made a , made a print out and uh , laminated it as far as easy steps to follow , uh , with the soft phone , uh , to make it as easy as possible for our experts to transition . And thankfully , um , experts started helping experts . If there was something in that outline , we may not have gotten to , they'd help us out and they give us a feedback and we apply it , uh , and make sure that everybody was on the same page .","One of the softwares we use to process claims , uh , was changing and we were short on trainers , uh , as well as supervisors . Um , so in order to get all our experts on the same page , of course , of myself , you know , and , uh , the director and then the head and stepped in and we took a , went ahead and trained , assisted in training the experts as well , which was very valuable cause of course being first hands on with it , we'd be able to give any feedback to , uh , the trainers , uh , that were doing , uh , that were doing the training . Um , thankfully with that we were able to meet the timeframe because we had about 120 experts , um , and we wanted to try to get them all trained and up to date and about two weeks . Um , and learning the new system thankfully wasn't very complex . It had a couple of similar things to the previous software that they used . Uh , just different locations , if you will , with the new one . Um , and we were able to achieve that goal . Thankfully .","As we were transitioning from the old software to the new one , uh , training department and our supervisors , uh , were advising me that , uh , experts weren't advised of this . For example , like how to transfer a client , um , where training department is advising . Yes , we were training them how to transfer . So in order to combat this , I went ahead and brought in our supervisors in our training department and have the training department go over when exactly they're being trained for this . So we could nip that right in the bud cause obviously transferring our clients very , very important part of the process . Um , so training the department went over it , supervisor like okay . And they were able to , uh , during their one-on-ones with their experts , be able to ask , especially those that were saying they were never trained for it . Able to nip that in the bud looked like everything was good . Um , and moving forward , well , we went ahead and did as well as we went ahead and recorded those training sessions to make sure everything was actually , uh , taught whenever before they hit the floor . Uh , using the new software .","Probably the most , uh , high pressure one was getting our experts train , going from hard phones to soft phones , especially trying to get it done within a two week span . So we went ahead and included the next year . We went through the weekend , so on Saturdays as well , we're going out here , um , being shorthanded trainers absolutely didn't help . So as myself had to go ahead and step in , uh , with the director , we got together and made it a Monday through Saturday . Uh , got everybody trained , uh , for the soft phones . Um , and thankfully was a great success , was able to get it . Actually it was two weeks , but we finished two days ahead , thankfully , and uh , was able actually to get an early weekend the following week .","We had , even during coven , thankfully we had actually a profitable year the year before January . Um , I had made the team a commitment that we were going to upgrade their monitors , um , uh , give a bit of a bigger screen and everybody's very excited for it . Um , but unfortunately as new year rolls around its goals for this year as far as everything goes . So unfortunately got behind with making the order for that . So , uh , I worked with , with our abdomen and I worked with , um , my , you know , my peer manager to make sure that we got these monitors ordered in and that they would be here by the second quarter of the year . Went ahead and made the order in , um , and actually had a meeting with them and was like , show them just a screenshot . Of course , didn't show them the costs , they don't need to know that , uh , but showed them a screenshot of how many monitors we ordered , uh , and that they have 24 inch monitors , uh , so that , uh , boost of morale a little bit that helped . Um , so that they know , uh , apologize to them . Cause sadly took longer than I was expecting . Um , but make the commitment to them and they should be having 24 inch monitors in second quarter .",3.333333333,2,3.666666667,2.666666667,2.666666667

Sometimes you wouldn't want to wait a little bit before you cut away . Yeah . Uh , there's people yelling and trying to discuss this in a very high speed , dynamic situation . But usually we ended up coming to cut away and freefall clear and open our reserves haven't done this yet . It works out for the most part . Um , but you always need to , everything's high-speed dynamic . You're getting lots of information with your eyeballs and your ears and trying to figure out what's going on rapidly . Uh , it really teaches you how to make decisions quickly and , but the purpose .","A couple of years ago , one of the new owners of the drop zone , um , was trying to do high speed maneuvers that were beyond his skill level at the time . And he ended up doing a low turn under his parachute into the ground and broke his femur . Me , his brother , our pilot , everybody was there . We , you know , had to , they put a tourniquet on the leg , they had to get the ambulance , we had to take care of everything and there's a lot going on . Uh , but you know , you have to stay calm and take care of emergency situations . Cause sometimes they will happen . Scott , I mean , people break bones and other things , but we got Tony to the hospital , um , and they took care of him at the femur and we , you know , we've had to work through , we had to work through dealing with that over the next six months as he was healing . But , uh , whenever somebody gets injured , it's super important to not get upset or you just need to stay calm and work with the situation and do what needs to be do to do what needs to be done to be able to help them out and , uh , possibly save their life .","After we were shut down for covered , the owners decided to open seven days a week to try to make up for lost money from covered . That made it a very difficult at times to get anything else done , whether it was dentist appointments or doctor's appointments or visiting people . Um , I had an elderly friend that I was , we used to go to lunch every Tuesday on a day off , but it became , um , more difficult to see her at all because , um , with working seven days a week and such unpredictable schedules , I had no ability to plan . Um , and that got very difficult , but we made it work . Um , and after a while the owners realized nobody can keep up with the seven day a week schedule where we didn't have enough staff . Nobody would have a day off ever . And that made it very difficult . So now we're back having two days off a week , which makes life better , um , and much less stressful and we can see other friends , we can plan our dentist appointments and all of that . Um , so it was just very hard to keep my commitment to her , to see her every week when we were working every day .",3,1.75,3,3.333333333,1.666666667
6,Pzc55fs-bfs238,"The time that I had to adapt to a changing or complex environment . That work was when we had a new director of the it department and he completely redid the department . Everyone's job changed in a period of just a month or two , he called everyone in for an interview . So the steps I took was to get my new job description and study it and try to learn about the various things that he would want me to do because they weren't things that my previous job had in them . And so that was my strategy .","I remember it was just around new year's day and a training project that I was leading was about to start . My customer was the HR department . We had inputted a new E time application where every employee of the place where I worked had to use new software to report their time as well as the time of their subordinates . And it was , as I said , new year's Eve . There was a last minute change in the handouts for that class from HR . And there was absolutely no way I could contact my boss . I couldn't do nothing , but I couldn't access my boss , which could have freed up the money to have these new handouts made . So I went out on a limb and ordered that myself , even though I'm not able to approve expenses . And I asked the HR person to talk to my boss the first business day after new year's and try to , um , make it okay with her .","It was a Monday morning and my client was a nonprofit and the job was to go to one of their locations and bring a certain amount of training manuals . Now these training manuals were not ready ahead of time and they were 200 pages . The question was , should I print ten two hundred and fifty page training manuals in the one hour I had before the class was going to start , which basically would fill up that entire time and then some , or should I try to make an informed decision about how many students are likely to be there and just print those many manuals . My boss had print 10 I knew only two people were going to be there , so that was the conflicting information . My action was , I did what my boss wanted . I regret it because eight of those manuals went entirely to waste .","The high pressure situation was that I had to give a pilot class for new application and my audience for that pilot class was the it department itself , which is the worst possible audience for a computer training class because they will hammer you with questions that normal students wouldn't even think of . So I was very , very stressed the entire weekend . Um , how I responded was to get a bunch of what I called brain exercises and interrupt the day with those sort of competitive brain teasers . My goal was to distract the audience so that they would be more concerned with the brain teasers than they would with asking meaningless questions . It worked pretty well .","Well , this is that nonprofit client that I spoke of earlier . It was a Friday and I had two conflicting priorities , two conflicting equipment commitments . One was I had to train a new provider , a new physician , and using this HR software . And the other was I was supposed to , um , teach a class at a different location for about eight nurses using a different application . Now the class was to take eight hours . The new user training was to take four hours . Both had to be done that day and no one else could do it . What I did was I spoke to the provider and found out they are scheduled , found out that they were a evening person and scheduled their class to be from six to 9:00 PM . I was able to teach both classes myself without disappointing anyone . So the outcome in this case was positive .",1.666666667,3.333333333,2.333333333,2,3
7,Pie5369-g3j2uj,"We went through a period of time at work in which we were changing supervisors and there was a lot of changes that were taking place . It wasn't just the fact that the supervisor was changing , it was the fact that all of the work policies and everything that we had learned was changing and being done differently . It really just took a lot of effort to get to know the person , to learn their likes and dislikes , to learn what was important to them as well as just kind of instruct them on some of the things that we had done in the past and what had worked for us as a team and what had been successful and got us the best results as a team . So it wasn't just only taking in information for them , it was also giving them information . It was a kind of push and pull situation in which we learn from them . They learned from us and we were able to implement some of the things that we had done in the past and learn new information from them of how they wanted things done . So we came to an agreement and come to a conclusion that worked best for all parties involved .","There was a time at work where a law had changed and we couldn't issue bench warrants for certain things anymore , so we had to go back and pull the warrants that we already had and there was quite a large , large number of them , so we had to go through them each individually . Why am I one to determine whether we were going to do away with a warrant , whether we were going to keep it , whether we were going to set it up for a payment hearing , whether we were going to just convert it to a fond . There was a lot of work that went into going through all of these warrants individually to assess them , but we just took the steps that we did them bit by bit . We would do so many a day , do them in alphabetical order and make decisions on them individually until we had everybody set up . We didn't try to do them all at once . We would have hearings with just a few people at a time each week until we went through the whole backlog . The forest . It was a lot of work , but they doing it piecemeal , that made it more manageable .","I had an situation come up in which we were getting ready to have jury trials and we had to schedule a certain number of jurors . Um , the judge wanted to do things the same way that we've been doing them . The court administrator wanted to change it up and do it differently , so it was my boss was telling me to do one thing and the judge was telling us to do another thing , so it was kind of a sensitive situation in which I really didn't know what to do . Ultimately it had come down to , I just had to pick something and do it in order to send out the juror summons and have everybody scheduled in a timely fashion . Ended up going with what the judge requested because I felt that ultimately it was , it was up to her to decide how she wanted to run the courtroom more so than it was my supervisor . I did go to my supervisor and let her know beforehand that I was going to do it this way , that she had , she had indicated that she wanted it done . And that way it kind of took the pressure off of me to show that I was doing it in a way in which the judge had requested it . But , um , having the conflicting information from the two of them made it very difficult to decide what to do initially .","We have auditors that come in on a yearly basis to look over our work and see what's what we're doing , how we're reporting things . But every once in a while we'll have an auditor that comes in and does a really intensive check . And to me it's always a stressful situation because it's only happened a couple of times and each time it happens , it's very nerve wracking . My supervisor pretty much puts me in charge of that , so I'm the one answering their questions , pulling receipts , pulling tickets , pulling reports and showing them . It's a lot of detailed questions . It's very one-on-one . You're there with the auditor answering their questions and it's , it's stressful . Um , I don't like being put in that situation , but yeah , it's something that I am putting into , so I have to do it and I just try to take my time , answer their questions as thoroughly as I can present all the evidence to them and be as cordial and polite as I can be to just get , get through it . It's usually like something that lasts most of the week , so it's a lot of work . You have to put your other work aside and just deal with the auditor .","My supervisor wanted me to help create a manual that would help with employees . It would help to kind of serve as a guide when we have questions or anything comes up , new hires or people who have been there for a while . She wanted me to work on this . Um , it became very difficult because it w when she wanted it done , we had a very high caseload . It was very hard to spend any time working on that when I would be in court for three hours at a time and then all the prep that went along with going to court and after court . It just made it very difficult to work on that and to make that a priority . When my other job became the main priority , I did explain to her that I was having trouble keeping up with that and getting this work done that I thought would be very helpful for us to have this God . So she understood the situation and she said , just to work on the God as I can , to not make that my number one priority , to put my other work ahead and then do it bit by bit . So I was able to , when it , when it was more of a law or when there wasn't so much court going on to be able to work on the manual , especially during coven had plenty of time for that . So I was able to work on it and get it accomplished in my downtime , but it , it had to take a back seat to my other work .",3,2,2.666666667,2.333333333,2.666666667
8,Pxfq37w-73yte4,"My current position required me to adjust to age change from in-person work by our safety and environmental staff to remote work where possible . Uh , this was due to responses we had to put in place for the pandemic . Our in office , uh , workplaces had people space too closely together , did not have adequate ventilation , so we had to , uh , disperse personnel to home offices temporarily while the workspaces were redesigned with adequate ventilation and filtration . In the meantime , we also had to ensure that our safety personnel could attend field work and evaluate the ongoing , uh , occupational exposures and hazards of the field workplace . Uh , we ended up having to create new communication protocols because many of our field operations required multiple personnel to interact while still maintaining sufficient separation for the early stages of the pandemic . Uh , we were able to implement that over the period of about six months while we redesigned the offices to provide adequate separation of personnel and adequate filtration . And in the end , we found that we would be able to redesign the workplaces in such a manner is to save , uh , uh , space by implementing a hotelling situation , uh , in order to have our personnel share workspaces during those times when it had to be in the office and , uh , maximize their ability to perform remote work when that would be satisfactory for getting the job done .","The situation involved in environmental cleanup project on a military test range . We had a structure that needed to be reused for other tests . The structure had been , uh , uh , very heavily contaminated with white phosphorus , uh , during the detonation of some experimental weaponry . A particular problem we encountered is that all of the steel surfaces inside structure had absorbed white phosphorous , uh , uh , during the heat of an explosion of something , uh , containing white phosphorus . Any steel or iron will act in roughly the same way . A iron frying pan gets seasoned . If you're familiar with cast iron cookery only in this case , instead of the oil entering the pores of the frying pan , it's the , uh , white phosphorus getting entered , uh , embedded into the pores of any steel or iron . It , uh , renders the structure unsafe for habitation . You can actually scrape steel surfaces and see it spark and ignite and the white phosphorus will slowly convert to phosphine gas , which is quite toxic . So , uh , what we had to do is develop a protocol for decontaminating and it eventually ended up , uh , that we had to implement cycles of , uh , alternately heating the , uh , steel surfaces with blow torches , uh , scrubbing them with a solution of an oxidation agent that oxidized the white phosphorus to phosphoric acid , which is water soluble and relatively nontoxic . And we had repeat that several times , and of course , everybody had to be dressed in protective gear respirators that could remove phosphine gas . Uh , uh , and it turned out to be a multistage process , but eventually , uh , we were able to work out a protocol that we implemented in that situation at other sites at that test range . And it worked out quite well .","The situation involved , uh , personnel and during a , a very large transformer that of the type that's used in substations . It was offline , obviously , and not energized . But the question was whether the , uh , uh , space inside that transformer would be considered what OSHA calls a confined space . Uh , there was some conf conflicting information on the regulatory status of that because OSHA , uh , has a standard for the electrical industry that considers some items in the electrical industry enclosed spaces rather than confined spaces . Technical difference is , uh , not something that's easy to explain if you're not familiar with the industry . But essentially the confined space is immediately life-threatening in enclosed spaces . Not , uh , our decision was to proceed as the , the transformers were confined spaces based on the idea that the more elaborate precautions needed and the procedures we would use would take more time and be more expensive , but , uh , being considerably safer for the people going into the spaces . And , uh , the outcome was that nobody got hurt or killed , which is what we were after .","The situation was that I was leading a team of environmental personnel , uh , analyzing the handling of , uh , a group of NATO activities in Bosnia in the 1990s . Uh , this was shortly after the , uh , uh , NATO forces implemented , uh , what's called the stabilization for us to ensure , uh , peacekeeping between the Bosniaks , uh , and , uh , the Serbs in the area . And , uh , we were there because that activity involved a lot of generation of military waste , uh , uh , petroleum oils , lubricants , certain hazardous materials that had to be managed . Anyway . The , uh , high stress situation was , uh , uh , weather prevented our leaving the area when the work was completed by the military aircraft we had come into . So we had to arrange , uh , uh , passage out through a territory that was still controlled by , uh , the Serbian , uh , separatists in a place called Brcko . And , uh , we were able to , uh , pass through on the ground with no more than a dirty looks . But , uh , it was a stressful situation that we were very happy to successfully , uh , leave Bosnia for hungry without , uh , any further incidents .","The situation involved conducting confined space safety training for electrical transmission industry personnel , uh , during the pandemic , uh , the training that we were doing is normally normally delivered hands on and is , uh , requires considerable travel to the field sites where the training was , was , uh , needed . Uh , we were flatly forbidden from conducting , uh , travel during the first portion of the pandemic . So what we ended up having to do to satisfy our commitment was to establish , uh , protocols for remote training for the confined space safety . And the outcome was barely satisfactory . Uh , the remote training is a significant , significant improvement over no training at all . However , there's a lot of , uh , handling of equipment , gas analyzers , retrievable harnesses that should be part of that training . And nobody has yet invented a good way of , uh , uh , doing remote training for hands-on , uh , operations of equipment . Um , so now that we can travel again , we're going back and , uh , redoing that portion of the training so people get the hands on experience .",3,2.666666667,3.333333333,2.333333333,2
9,Prtcx5j-cnhydz,"I was the project manager for a huge renovation that we were undertaking . One of our properties . It was actually almost $2 million renovation . And right in the middle of it , we had a construction crew up and quit , which without them we couldn't do anything . And our business was kind of torn apart and we were still trying to stay open per the owners requests to try to make some money during this . So we had to really scramble and get anybody we could into at least kind of finish and clean things up till we could find another crew . There ended up being a lawsuit actually , um , by my , by the owner against the original crew .

And we really have this kind of hard goal that we wanted at least this initial training done by a certain date . And Oh , it was really , really hard . Half the time due to working shortages at Kova , the actual ID creation site was down and they had no help workers either for us , um , when we had a glitch . But , um , happily we ended up getting it all done . At least we're kind of in the midst of it . But the first step or rung on that ladder is completely done . And now we're in the middle of the second part .","Um , recently due to the pandemic , our revenue was down . We had lost a lot of clients due to there being no business travel . And we were faced with having to decide whether to accept some lower rated business than we normally would , but it was guaranteed business and there was a lot of it . And even though it's something we normally wouldn't do , it could potentially generate revenue that we wouldn't make otherwise . It also have the opposite chance of closing out on the nights . That group was there , um , other business , higher rate of business . But we decided and we had to decide very , very quickly because , uh , somebody else would have taken that opportunity . So we decided to go for it . And so happy we did , even though travel has picked up , um , it , we took it selectively on certain nights that are less in demand . And , uh , I'm really , really glad we did , especially now with inflation and , uh , gas prices .

Um , I was relatively new to that company , but had had a lot of education and experience , um , and showed up just like everybody else .

And since I had experience in that background , I had to lead this presentation in front of the whole staff with material I hadn't even prepared for , but it was more of general .

10,P5dvgmx-f7gjui,"So there was a time when , um , my organization wanted to switch the structure and instead of having us work departmentally , we were going to begin working in teams . And so that was a change that I had to adapt to because I was new to the company . So what I did was , uh , during break , I went around and introduced myself to all of my new team members . And it allowed me to open the door to establish a rapport and a relationship with everyone who I was going to be working with . So although I was familiar with the department I worked in , all the team members were new , and I felt like that was a great icebreaker and it actually worked beautifully .","So I was tasked with , uh , doing a project which consisted of creating a reel and I was not really familiar with what the process entailed . So what I did was I kind of mapped it out in three stages . I did my research stage , I did my planning and implementing stage , and then I did my review stage and my research stage . I went around and asked people who had had to do that same project before . I'm in my implementation stage . I laid out everything , I crafted the project , I finished the project . Uh , I reviewed the project multiple times and I submitted the project and then in the review stage I went and got feedback from my supervisors about how the project went . Um , I verified that I had actually done this by myself and um , I just took notes on things that maybe I could have done better the next time . But the review stage I think was the most important stage for me because it was the learning stage and actually that's where I garnered the most confidence . I realized I had done the project that I had not anticipated . I had structured it properly . I had crafted a timeline that was realistic and I had ended up with optimal results . Everyone was happy with the project and I felt like , okay , after this I can pretty much set a goal and accomplish anything I need to do .","So one of my tasks was to create interest health interstitials , which are basically one to three minute little video programs which cover a health topic like diabetes . And so one day I had gotten two different copies or scripts from two different departments and they both looked great . Um , I wasn't sure which one I should go with . So in the moment I had to rely on whatever knowledge I had of the topic at hand . I had to use my instincts and my judgment to choose which one would be the most appropriate . I did that . I sort of dotted my I's and crossed my T's and made a judgment about what would be the best look for the company , what would it represent the brand , the best , and the most powerfully . And I went with that . And the results of that was that we had a really great , informative , informative health interstitial , which covered a topic that few people were knowledgeable of , and management was really happy with it .","So in order to complete my bachelor's degree , I had to take a calculus course . Uh , but right before the final exam , I was traveling and I left my textbook in one of my bags that didn't make it where I was going . So I had to study for the final exam without a coursebook . So I had to think on my feet . I said , what should I do ? So I thought , I said , okay , what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the library and track down that book and copy the pages . So that's exactly what I did . I went to the library . I found the textbook that we were actually using . I took it to the Xerox machine . I copied the relevant chapters of the things that we had covered in the things that I knew were going to be the exam , and I was able to study for it . I needed this course . I needed to get a C or higher in order to get my bachelor's degree . I had done all the pre-course work for all the other courses , and this was the last course that I had to take . And the last exam that I had to take and I absolutely had to pass it and I didn't have the book . So by thinking on my feet and going to the library and copying the pages , I was able to study , able to pass the exam and able to get my bachelor's degree .","So I had a friend that was going to be in a really high profile play at one of the great playhouses in our city . Uh , but at the same time I also had a work project that I needed to be on . We had a deadline that we needed to complete . Uh , so I had to really decide how I was going to handle this . So what I decided to do was go to my boss and say , Hey , listen , I've got to leave work today . Really need to leave as close to closing time as possible . I can't stay any later . Um , is there any way that I could work this out ? And what I had decided to offer him , as I said , listen , I'm going to be the project lead for the rest of the week . And that way I can cross the finish line . We can cross the finish line earlier . So I'm going to come in early for the rest of the week and leave later . But today I've got to leave on time . So I think if I wanted to summarize how I was able to handle that , how I was able to meet my commitment while leaving early when we were on a project that was going to have a firm deadline . Essentially what I did was barter with time . I decided , Hey , I can come in early . I can make up my time early before anyone else and really get the team off to a great start and then stay later all the other days in the week . So what I thought about was just transferring time . I thought of time as a resource and how I could allocate it the most effectively by thinking that way , I was able to do both . Not only was I able to support my friend , I was able to bring the project home and record time again with optimal results . I was really actually proud of that project too . It became one of my signature efforts while I was at that company .",3,3.333333333,3,3,4
11,Pyw4d5b-g99edv,"So the most recent time that I can think of is the covert pandemic where everything changed overnight . And we moved from our offices right back to working from home . And it had been something that we had done from time to time , but not on a full time , um , permanent basis . And so dealing with the complexities of technology requirements , equipment , um , figuring out workload and also just dealing with morale from our staff and , um , colleagues was a challenge and it made things very complex at times . And the steps that I took to adapt to that situation was by simply being calm , listening to my team members , concerns , speaking with each of them individually to find out what their needs were and how I could meet those needs for them . And then I took that and reported back to the executives . That way I was able to listen to everyone's individual needs , especially at that time where everything was so uncertain and unknown rather than doing a collective , uh , agreement or a collective , uh , proposition . I thought it was very important that everybody was heard , uh , equally and individually . And so that was the first step . I did was talk to each person on my team , find out what they needed as we changed into this full time scenario , uh , environment and find out from our it team in the faculty to best support my team members , um , you know , needs and the equipment that they needed and all of that . And , and then the next step I did was simply to , uh , propose everything that I'd collected from all of the individual team members to the executives and to make sure that , um , we were able to fulfill all of those needs and requirements . And most importantly , what I did after that is even as we were moving into this new environment and use scenario was I made sure to follow up after the fact to make sure that there were no additional problems or to make sure that everything was running smoothly . Find out from each of them , you know , how if they needed anything else from me or in general , any way that I could help them as best as I could , just to really ensure as smooth of a process as possible . And I found that it was a very successful venture , and by doing that , there were no problems that were bubbling under the surface and were able to kind of nip that in the bud and keep all the staff satisfied as a result .","So as a result of the pandemic , we had to move , of course , like everybody else , all of our in person events , um , to virtual . And these were things that we had never done before . Uh , traditionally it was always in person and we had never thought of alternatives until the pandemic came about , which was our convocation ceremony where every year hundreds of our students from the faculty would walk the stage and graduate , uh , because of the pandemic . We obviously could not do that . And so we had to go through the challenge of moving all of that from in-person , traditionally to virtual in a zoom component . And rather than , you know , obviously they couldn't walk a stage , they couldn't do the traditions of , um , you know , wearing the cap and gown and all of that . And so what we tried to do was , um , instead of making it a formal ceremony , we wanted to create it as a celebration . And so that was the goal that I had set with the team . And we decided we wanted to try to aim for at least 70% attendance out of the graduates . Um , who would have attended in person . So that was a very big goal , especially for something we had never done before in this , uh , you know , in this virtual setting before . And so , you know , the steps that I took to reach that goal was simply , uh , forming a committee , which included members of my team and members of the external team , including members of , um , our it team , um , events , uh , and our university communications team as well . And we came up with a plan , an event outline , and we also , because we were tight on schedule , we ended up coming up with , um , an email campaign , um , to promote our celebrations , sending out the invitations . And we also came up with an idea on trying to really encourage engagement . And so we ended up coming up with a complication boxes that we mailed out to all of our graduates . And it had a bunch of little goodies in there and we even were able to obtain , um , caps that they could wear during the ceremony . And we had contests for people who dressed up and sharing their virtual celebrations . And , um , we weren't able to quite hit the 70% Mark , but we hit about 60 , which , you know , for us , that was in the range of what we had hoped we had . We were aiming for 70 , but we did set a range from at least 55 to 70 . And so we were very happy with that result , especially cause it was our first time and under those circumstances . And we had never done it before . So it was a great challenge .","A perfect example of , this was actually my very first job when I was working for a movie theater in the concession area . Um , I had been , we were actually just closing up shop for the evening and I was actually in the back in the kitchen area starting to do the cleaning . And suddenly I heard a commotion at the very front in the concession area , um , in the cashier area . So I walked over and there was a heated exchange between one of my coworkers and a customer and it ended up with , you know , some not nice words between the two and my coworkers storming off . And so I tried to , and when that had happened , I had went and listened to the customer and then I listened to my coworker . And of course I heard a lot of conflicting information from both of them , very different accounts of who is right , who was wrong , um , you know , what was said , what wasn't said and all of that . And so what I ended up doing as a result was I knew that I had to remedy the situation immediately , regardless of who was right , who was wrong , all of that , you know , just to make the customer happy because , you know , it just was not a good situation . And so I immediately took over , told my colleague to make sure to go to the back , stay in the back , um , don't come back in the front . Um , you know , until I had finished speaking with this lady and I spoke with her and just said , I don't even remember the , what the exact problem was , but it was something to do with her order . And so what I ended up doing was I credited her , I apologize profusely , not only for the situation but for my coworker's behavior . And I just doctor quickly in that moment , just trying to , you know , ease the tension and really just calm everybody down and to just stay focused on resolving the situation as quickly and as smoothly as possible . And so what I ended up doing was I ended up , you know , like I said , crediting her order , but I also , uh , added something and it was under , you know , I pretty much took the credit for that . Like I pretty much paid for that so that she could , um , be happy . And I spoke with my supervisor manager after told them the situation and , you know , I , it was only 15 years old and didn't have any , um , a lot of experience at that point . And I just explained what I did . And I ended up actually getting employee of the month as a result for that . And I ended up getting promoted , um , because of how quickly I was able to resolve the situation . And the lady herself actually went to a manager after and told her what I had done and that she felt really satisfied and happy that I had listened to her and that I kind of went above and beyond to credit her and to ease the situation .","So one of my responsibilities in my present role is , um , managing and updating our , um , website . And I was actually away on the weekend because I work Monday to Friday . And so we were just not working because it was the weekend . And I decided to check my email and I received a notification that our website had crashed . And so that was a very high stressful situation because it was actually , it was on a Sunday morning . And so I ended up contacting a member of our it team . I contacted them by email and actually by text messages while just to say we need to remedy the situation right away and fix this problem to find out what happened , why it crashed , make sure it wasn't a hack job or something like that , make sure we weren't hacked or anything like that . And I just immediately sprung into action and got on there to try to take a look and find out what happened , what was the reason for the crash . And I was on the phone with a member of my , um , on the it team to work together to resolve this . And , um , we pretty much worked together , um , all , all of Sunday from our respective homes , um , to try to find out what happened . And after a few hours he was able to figure out the reason for the website crash . And as a result , we actually lost a lot of pages . And so I had to go back into the backend to find , to see if I could find those lost pages and to reactivate the pages . And if they were lost , I had to go through and kind of do an audit of our website to find out what was still present , what was missing . And so that on Monday I can meet with the rest of the team and figure out where to go from there . And so it was a very stressful situation , especially on a Sunday because as we were heading into Monday , because we have so many students perspective , current students who rely on our website being up not only just up to date , but active in general . And so having a crash , uh , especially in a season where it was very , um , a lot of applications were open for our programs . And so it was absolutely critical . We tried to solve this and get the information back up there as fast as possible . Um , the outcome was , luckily after I did the audit on Sunday and going through all the pages , it took the entire day , all day , and practically almost all of the evening on Sunday , but we were able to get the website up again and I was able to actually get all of the pages , luckily activated again . So luckily it all worked out and there were no further issues after that .","So in my role , um , in addition to running events , I also write , um , faculty and students stories that go on our website and social media channels . And I do a lot of stories around the time of convocation ceremony . So typically pre it we would have our in persons event , which , um , I didn't have too much involvement with because it was a university effort . Um , I mainly focused on writing stories , numerous stories that would then be published on our website and social media channels . And so it took a lot of time to schedule , you know , interviews with the subjects , do any followups if necessary , and just that entire writing process takes months , uh , because it's numerous stories at a time , at least five to seven stories during that period as we roll it out , a couple stories a day throughout the week of graduation week . So anyways , um , because of the pandemic , we couldn't do the in person traditional ceremony , so we had to move to virtual , which was something we had never done before . There was no blueprint for that . We were starting completely from scratch that entire concept , um , for a virtual event . And so that was a huge priority for me . And as a result , I just didn't have enough time to do my usual writing for all the different stories , but it had to be done . And so what I did was I asked my colleague to assist in conducting the interviews on my behalf . So in order to leave my team member , you know , not to leave them hanging , what I ended up doing was , and to make sure that everything ran smoothly , I provided all the outlines for each of the subjects . I provided all the interview questions and any followups that I could anticipate potentially , um , brewing from those interviews . And I sent everything to him and said , if you have any questions , please let me know . And , um , it went smoothly . He was able to conduct all the interviews without issue and we were able to kind of meet all the deadlines and for the traditional writing stories and story deadlines . And I was able to focus more of my energy and time on this virtual event , which took way more of a priority . And we were able to successfully manage to execute this awesome virtual event that had great attendance . And I was able to meet my deadline for all the stories as well . And so luckily with some help , we were able to succeed . And , uh , it was wonderful .",4,3.5,3.333333333,3.666666667,4.333333333
12,Pp8c2w3-596ex6,"Corporate restructuring is always a difficult thing to happen within a company . One of the most complex times that I've had in my working career was when I was involved in a corporate restructuring and I had to see many of my close friends and colleagues , uh , lose their jobs and find new employment . I was tasked with leading a brand new team , uh , much smaller mind you , but still an new to me team of employees that had to still meet all of our corporate goals , um , both quarterly and yearly . What I wanted to do was cultivate a culture of acceptance , tolerance , trust and mutual accountability . And I tried to do this by constantly being available to my team members leading by example , uh , coming in early , staying late , uh , being available by email , by text message continuously . And it didn't happen immediately , but over time I think that I earned the trust and , uh , respect of my colleagues and that group of five individuals , um , I think outperformed the , uh , the prior groups , um , by all bounds and metrics that we measured , um , at our , at my prior company , um , by a large scale . So I think by investing in myself and having trust in the people around me , um , I was able to adapt to a difficult situation and eventually come out on top .","One of the most difficult projects that I've been a part of was trying to win over a longterm competitors client and bring them over to our , our company's firm . And I remember sitting there and trying to come up with ideas to win this client over during our pitch . And one of the things that sort of I tried to do was put myself in their shoes and see I've been a longterm client company , a , what can company B do for me that company cannot do or has not been doing . Uh , so I went through , looked at um , their revenues , look at how long they've been with this company and try my best to , uh , provide new value and measure what we could do for that company and present it to them in a , in a meaningful , tactful and I think in a unique and interesting way . Um , it took many meetings , lots of discussions , many pitches , um , but after nine to 10 months of continuous work , we're able to wrestle that , that client away from their longterm , um , our , our longterm competitor and eventually bring them over to our side . And I think that was one of my , uh , my biggest wins , but also one of my biggest challenges as well in my career .","A few years back , it was suspected that one of my colleagues was providing , um , uh , violating nondisclosure and giving information to , um , a client that was obviously not allowed and I didn't have complete proof of this incident taken place . Um , I heard from , um , you know , other people that this was happening and , uh , I knew that if it got , you know , if it got up the food chain , that not only would this person be terminated , but my job might also be in danger as well . So I had to act quickly and I had to be decisive in my actions . So instead of , um , you know , trying to figure out the truth through hearsay and , and , you know , trying to put pieces of the puzzle together , I decided just to go confront this individual has some point blank what was happening , how this client got this information , whether they were the source of this information . And , um , in doing so , I was able to discover that , that they were in fact , uh , violating our company policy and , um , they were apologetic for it . Um , obviously they were under a lot of duress and stress . Um , in their lives and made poor decisions . And I think that it , um , reinforced for upper management that I had the company's best interest in mind . And the outcome was a , was a positive one , um , for the company overall as we were able to , uh , you know , get rid of an individual who was not , not trustworthy .","Certainly one of the most high stress situations that I had to deal with was , um , our transition plan from , um , pre pandemic to , uh , work working through the pandemic . And , uh , I remember a couple of years ago , uh , sitting down and , and realizing that we didn't really have a plan in place as to how we were going to transition from being a company and a team that was constantly in meetings and constantly face-to-face to now being remote and having to , uh , you know , change the way that we operate in this , in our sort of new world . Um , you know , brainstorming with colleagues , other project managers , um , upper management , we're able to come up with , uh , I think the most normal and tangible , uh , situation where we would still meet regularly . It used to be , um , you know , via zoom calls , uh , during the , the height of the pandemic . But of course , now that we're sort of on the other side a little bit , uh , we were able to still maintain some of that . Um , I think some of the benefits of that transition , um , being able to be more flexible in our approach to meetings , um , but still work hard , um , execute on all of our , all of our deliverables . And of course , uh , you know , be responsible for , um , high performance within the company .","Unfortunately , uh , you know , the work , the line of work that we're in dictates that there's going to be some nights that are longer than others and may have meetings that go a while in the night .

Um , and I sort of left , um , you know , my wife in a difficult situation , having to care for our two at the time , very young children and , um , not being there was , um , a sad time for me because I know that it was a special time for my , my wife and her sister and our family .

13,Paaw4gu-ee8fwj,"I was managing a project over in Beijing , China . It was to build a building and I had about a hundred people working underneath me . One of the projects that I had to get done needed to be done in about a couple of months . I was able to work with about 20 of the 100 people that I managed and we were able to successfully put the project into bit sized pieces so that we could also come out ahead of schedule with that project . Um , we were able to , uh , make the , uh , developer of the building very happy because we saved them a substantial amount of money and it's always a good thing . So the first thing that we did was I had to make sure that I put the best folks on the job . So I found those folks . I let them know what we needed to do . We came up with a plan as a team . I broke it . That plan made sense . And within about two to three weeks , we were able to make that plan a reality and I will forever be , um , happy . And I'm very , very happy that we were able to make that a reality for them .","I also happened to be working overseas and Beijing , China . At this point in time I was managing an English school and um , my boss , I was actually a supervisor , let me correct myself and my boss came to me and let me know , look , I know that you're already working on a project but I also need for you to work with a coworker on another project . And so what I needed to do was balance two separate projects at the same time and I will tell you that it was very difficult . But what I did to achieve the goal , I made sure that I had a planner , I'm talking a physical planner and I wrote everything down that I needed to do and I made sure that I also put everything into bite sized pieces . By doing that , I was able to know that I was reaching the goals for what I needed to accomplish in order to get the project done for my boss . And by me having my planner and putting everything into bite sized pieces and checking in regularly with my planner , I was able to make sure that everything happened on time . And of course I worked with my coworker to make sure that everything happened on time and we came together at the very beginning to make sure that everything that we did was going to work towards our goal , and we were able to accomplish everything . And the project was a winning success . And the students at our school absolutely loved it and enjoyed it .","At one point in my life , I had actually applied to become a flight attendant . And over the course of about two to three months , I had my flight attendant interviews . In the end out of doing maybe five to 10 interviews , I wound up with I think three jobs . And so it was a very , um , uh , important decision that needed to be made about which company that I would go to do my training with . And I was definitely faced with conflicting information because , um , one company had contacted me directly . Another company contacted me through email while another company had contacted me . Um , I do believe through , uh , calling my emergency contacts , which is another long story in and of itself . And so what I did , I just methodically made sure that I contacted each of the sources directly to receive feedback . In fact , one of the sources I actually drove from the Chicago land area to Indianapolis to sit down and find out what the actual truth was . This was in early 2000 . And so I was still at a place in my life where I felt if you really need to know the truth , you gotta go to the source . So that's what I was doing back then . And the outcome of my decision was that I was quickly able , after doing the research , I was able to find out that , uh , two out of the three companies I did not want to work for and I selected the best choice and it wound up being a good selection for me . But I will tell you , uh , for that month it took me about a month to figure out , uh , the conflicting information to find out what was true and what was false . It was , uh , very , very , very , uh , trying times . But I did quickly make a decision because I needed to figure out , uh , like I said earlier , um , had an opportunity to go to training with three different airlines . And so , um , they do move slowly , but I still had to provide a quick answer . And so again , it took me about a month and within that industry that is quickly and , um , at least back then it was , and that is my answer . Thank you .","I happened to be working in Shinjuku Taiwan over the summertime in 2000 and I will tell you it was my first summer and I did not realize this , but over the summertime in that part of the world is when people really , really want to study English . And so I went from working only like four hours in the afternoon during the school year to basically working from seven o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock at night , Monday through Friday . And then on Saturdays I worked four hours my normal schedule . So what happened was for about two and a half months , I was overwhelmed and I was in a very , very , very stressful situation at work . And how I responded was like this . I knew that even though I like to stay up late at night , that over that summer I could not stay up late at night any longer . What I had to do with have a sleep schedule that was the same every single day , I could no longer go out to Taipei to be able to party . I had to be focused on six days a week being focused on providing the most ultimate level of service and care for my students that I possibly could . And so what that meant was I went to sleep at night for eight hours . I made sure that I ate correctly . I made sure that I kept my body hydrated and I made sure that I didn't go out and have fun . I made sure that I was completely focused . Now I'm going to tell you something about that . When you do something like that for two and a half months , when it's over , you want to be compressed . You want to to sleep , you want to have fun . You want to do all of the things that you couldn't do because you basically felt like a robot for two and a half months , Monday through Friday , 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and then in the mornings on Saturdays , and you do that for , you know , almost eight . Well , let me see , um , 10 and a half weeks . That's really gonna work on you . But I will tell you , when I finally had an opportunity to be compressed , I felt good and the outcome was that I was able to pay off a $10,000 credit card bill that I had made when I was a student . And I wasn't smart at that time , but that was the outcome .","I happen to be working at a job where I felt completely drained every single day and so I was able to keep up with my important part Ortiz , but in my home life that was a completely different story . So there was this young lady that I had liked a lot and I always wanted to go out on a date with her and after about a year she finally decided I wasn't stalking her . But after about a year I finally made up the courage to say , can we go out on a date ? But I came home from work on the night that we were supposed to go on the date and I'm going to tell you what happened . I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up it was a couple of hours past our date and at that point she didn't want anything more to do with me at all . I had completely vanquished , I guess that's the word you can use or eliminate it . Any possible chance , any possible opportunity of ever being able to go out with her ever again . And I will tell you that was the outcome of experiencing a difficulty , keeping commitments outside of work . I have never had any difficulty keeping , um , commitments or that I have to take care of at work . I will go out of my way to make sure , absolutely sure , absolutely certain , to make sure that I do everything in my power to keep my commitments because I know that if I don't , that backup lead to negativity and I don't like that . So that was a story about how my work priorities prevented me from keeping a commitment to a date that I had . And I still think over , um , 26 , 27 years ago , I still think about that opportunity that I blew .",3.333333333,3,2.666666667,3,1.666666667
14,P4xi5da-6nu4hv,"As a staff accountant , I constantly deal with complex and changing work environments . For instance , as an accountant during this recent COBIT crisis , our accounting firm set up a covert account where we collect reclass , contract labor related to COBIT and all like safety and sanitizing supplies to the covert account . As a result , I had to look over expenses that were coded to the of account to make sure they qualify and weren't and shouldn't have been reclassed to like general supplies , regular contract labor . And in addition , I had to check the regular expense accounts to see if anything qualified to be reclassed to the covert account . I do change my work ethic to work longer hours during that time to get all my regular tests done and the extra covert related tasks . After about a month or two , it really went well and we transitioned to this new guidance and that was all I completed all my normal tasks plus the cupboard and we made the financial statements more accurate .","As an accountant .

I then submitted by County to my manager to get approval to send out that accounts payable payment to the County . I then updated my Excel sheet to make sure I paid all the accounts and check the general ledger to make sure that accounts payable actually paid all the real estate taxes .

I emailed them to see which one had a better understanding of the contract labor for that community and may might rule based on how I felt , which that which person knew best the contract labor was for that community . As a result , I'm decided the executive director had more information about that Khamenei and made their accrual based on their estimate and as a result , the accrual was made more accurately for that month and the financial statements would delivered accurately .","As an accountant .

Which of these things can be put on hold for a season in which of those things are something that only maybe I could do ? And so I began to divvy those things up , but really just get above the line and think about , okay , well we need to actually fill some of these spots , and as we fill them , is there a way to streamline this ? Is there a way to create a new position that's even more helpful for the company and begin to use it as an opportunity ? Not really to not think of it as a step back , but maybe a step forward for our team , for our vision and for our mission .","You know , as I think about project management and having to tackle things that can't be done in a single city or even by one person , I just think about the different tools that are available and developed by people around the world .

And so recently there was a situation in which I had to think about a complex legal document that had to be developed for a merger that our branch was going through . And so , um , I remember I , I reached out to a different colleagues , so it was kind of my first step was kind of a research phase in which I was getting information and input from people who had done it before . Um , and then after that I went to a kind of a drafting stage in which I , um , kind of pieced together this , this document based off the information that was available in the information and advice that I had gotten from colleagues and other people who had done it . And then after that stage , I kind of took that informally to some of the leadership here and began to walk through some of the different things and get tweaks of feedback . Um , and then as an extra step , I kind of went through informally to some of the leadership of the other branch that was emerging and kind of talked through some things that I knew would probably , um , create anxiety for them or that they would have questions about . And so by the time that we actually got to the kind of , the official time to merge with asylum and everything had been ironed out and it was a very smooth and easy process , but I know that that would not have been possible if we had just kind of rolled into it , you know , unprepared . Uh , and so I think there's , there's a huge role in , in preparation and taking the right steps when you're thinking about projects that can't be done in a single city .","You know , there was a situation recently where there was an issue that came up at work that was very time sensitive because it had to do with , um , kind of our , our financials . And so it was a very time sensitive and privileged kind of situation . And so I remember , um , walking into that day , that day , not expecting that . And kind of what I did in that moment as I was presented with the situation was I had to draw from previous experience . And I basically , instead of doing a pros and cons list at what I did instead was a , what I call a coin flip decision . Um , and that's basically just imagining that you were flipping a coin and then you had to make a decision before the , the coin landed or you caught the coin . And usually that intuition , that gut response is the right response . And so I'll admit it , this situation , I , I used the coin flip decision , uh , and I , and I took a stance and I , and I made it just made a call essentially . Um , and honestly , neither of the options were great . Um , and yet I felt good about the decision because I went with intuition and I went with what I thought would be the best possible scenario with the , with the greatest mitigation of risk .","No . For me , there's a particular day of the week in which , um , our organization puts on events , big events that are very complex and involve a lot of pieces . And so obviously it feels like every week there is a high pressure or stressful situation in which I have to cope with . Uh , but I've learned to do a few things that I think actually could be applied in any position , especially in a project manager role . And so some of the things that I do to cope through a suborn stressful situations is , um , I often take a step back and I remember why I'm in the position that I'm in . Like when I'm feeling overwhelmed or when people are coming to me with a lot of problems , I take a step back and I remember that , you know , I am equipped and qualified for the position that I'm in and people are coming to me with questions and with issues because they know that I can handle it . And so that's the first thing that I do . Just take a step back and remember that as secondly , I will often triage , um , um , stressful things or questions . And I'll think about , okay , well , which of these actually is the most urgent is the most important , which of these in my assessment do I think are the most important , which are just as something that someone else is bringing to me , but that actually isn't that important or isn't that urgent ? And so I'll kind of do a mental triage as I think about things . And then number three , um , I pull in other people , you know , uh , part of the pressure that we feel , our stress that we feel is because we put it on ourselves and that we have to be the person who answers everything . And so I've learned to build a good team around me and to trust that team . And so often people come to me with issues or urgent matters and I'll , I'll put it right back on them and I'll say , you are equipped to figure this out . You can do that . That's why you're in the role . And so I use those three strategies in any stressful situation . And they have really helped me in terms of longevity and the quality of my work life .","So recently I made a commitment with a potential client by setting up a meeting with them that it was all confirmed and I was prepping for it . And then shortly before that happened , there was someone higher up in my organization who scheduled a meeting with me . And I remember feeling that tension between keeping this commitment of meeting with this client and meeting with someone who is important in our organization . And I remember feeling a little bit nervous , but going to a kind of this higher up person . And just explaining that I had , that I had put this meeting on the calendar that I thought it was important , not just because it was potential client , but because it was a commitment to my word and I represent our organization . And so I just remember that person responding really well even though what they were meeting about was really urgent for them as well . Um , and so we were able to work it out , but I felt like at the end of that , I not stood up for myself , but I stood up for our company in a good way . Um , by , you know , pushing forward what was most important , which is meeting with clients and doing our job , et cetera . So , um , it , it was difficult keeping that commitment , but , uh , I felt good about the outcome .",4.666666667,3.5,2.333333333,4.666666667,4
17,Pjuqdcx-cj4sas,"Being an elementary school teacher , uh , adapting to a changing or complex work environment is what I do on a daily basis . Um , I'm constantly having to think on my feet to change direction , um , in the lessons that I'm teaching to my kids . So I always have the end goal in mind . But the path that I've picked or the path that I think is going to be best isn't always the one that we ended up taking . Uh , there's a lot of times where equipment doesn't work . Um , a fire drill happens , principal or somebody else comes into the room and it just completely can derail what needs to be done . Um , however , keeping that target , that vision , that goal in mind and finding the work around is what leads to being successful in the classroom . Sometimes that means you completely walk away from it for a couple of hours and try again later in the afternoon with a different mindset , a different strategy . Sometimes it means coming back the next day and try and on another day . Um , but being able to be flexible , adaptable , and ultimately still get people where you want them to be . And where they need to be is what makes a successful teacher .","Part of my current job involves , um , a goal setting conference at the startup every year where my team and I sit down together , um , pick a goal for ourselves and for our students and then meet with our direct supervisor to talk about what our goal is and how we're going to get our students to meet that goal . Uh , after the goal has been set , we've come up with a list of strategies and things that we're going to do in order to meet that goal . Um , and we get started on it . We work through strategies , methods that we think are going to be best . Um , but we're also not beholden to those . We're willing to take a step back and reassess along the way to make sure that not only the students were making the progress that they need to make , but the , we're making the progress that we need to make towards meeting that goal . Um , it's a lot of what we call formative assessment , where you're taking data along the way , analyzing that data to see if your students are on the right track , if they're ahead of where you thought they would be , if they're behind where you thought they would be . And , uh , constantly adjusting to meet the needs of everyone and ultimately be successful in meeting that goal .","Recently , I have a situation at work where , um , we were out on the playground and one of my students got hurt . Um , and that immediately took all my attention , all my focus and all my energy . Um , it was a very chaotic situation because there were a lot of other kids around and a lot of kids that were reacting to the injury . Um , thankfully it ended up not being as bad as it looked . Um , but kids were running and uh , collided heads and a girl forehead was split up and bleeding pretty severely . Um , a lot of the kids were trying to explain what happened , tell me what happened . And right then and there that wasn't what was important , what important was taking care of the situation at hand and getting her the care that she needed . Um , I delegated for other people to go get supplies to stop the bleeding . Um , I had somebody else call the office to let them know that we were going to be sending this girl down , that they could be expecting her , that they could get ready and prepare for that . Um , I got that situation taken care of . I got the gauze pad on the girl's head to kind of contain and stop the bleeding . I got the , uh , another adult to walk her down to the office and I then started collecting the information from the kids and , um , kind of processing what happened with the kids that were , uh , witnesses and bystanders and were affected and shaken up by , by what they saw happen to one of their friends . Um , like I said , luckily , uh , it didn't end up being as bad as it looked . Um , I believe that the girl needed to go to the doctor and get some either stitches or a glue to close the wound . Uh , but it healed nicely . It was up in her hairline where there's not going to be any visible scarring and , uh , it was handled well .","Um , most recently I dealt with a high pressure , stressful situation when , uh , there was an angry parent that came into the building , uh , wasn't a parent of one of my students , but it was , um , a parent of a student in our building and they were upset about something that had happened to their child , uh , at the hands of another child . Um , I was one of the first person that they contacted or made contact with in the front of the building . Uh , I could tell just by their physical appearance that they were agitated , upset , worked up . Um , and I knew that being confrontational , um , or , you know , telling them to calm down , take a deep breath , that none of that would , uh , help the situation , move the situation forward . In fact , it would probably have the potential to make the situation worse . So , um , the first thing I did was I just let them know that I heard them . And , uh , I just wanted to connect with them on a professional level , but also on a personal level , I let them know that I myself am a parent and that , uh , I would be very upset if that happened to my child too . And uh , I won them over by getting them on my side . And you know , just I think that initial hearing or feeling that you've been heard and feeling that somebody is taking you seriously is a lot , ER is enough . A lot of times it just came up , take the situation from here down to here . Um , and after you build that trust , you can get that situation from there , maybe even down to here . And um , that's where the true progress and work is made because you're able to work through the problem instead of just being angry at the problem . Um , and that's what happened in this case . The , the parent , like I said , was , was visibly angry when they arrived at the school . I felt like I was able to get the situation deescalated a little bit and not to the point that I was comfortable bringing them into the office to talk with the principal and , um , they could work through the rest of the story . I don't know what the outcome of it was because like I said , it didn't involve one of my students . So I wasn't privy to that information . But , um , I know that the situation I went a whole lot better than it would've if , um , somebody had been confrontational and tried to , Um , Take the , take the problem head on .","Mmm . Last year I volunteered to be the head coach , my son's T-ball team , which wasn't something that I had originally planned on doing . Uh , I had planned on helping being volunteer in some capacity . I had not envisioned , um , being the head coach who was planning practices , contacting parents , organizing and scheduling all of that . Um , it wasn't a role that I felt comfortable taking on and I knew that I didn't have the time to take it on . Um , my work keeps me very busy . Um , but it fell upon me and it was kind of presented as well . Unfortunately , we're not going to have a team for these kids if you don't take this on . Um , so I delegated , I had people that I knew , people that I trusted , um , take care of certain aspects of things that I was not able to do . So , uh , I could commit to being a practices . Um , I scheduled practices when they worked into what worked for me . Um , I did not have time to be contacting parents , calling parents , texting parents during the day , so I put that onto my wife . Um , There was some pushback initially and she wasn't appreciative of the fact that I put that onto her , but she ultimately realized that it's what , what I needed and what was going to help the team and our son be successful and have this work . So she took it on . Um , we were able to build some relationships with some parents , um , once the season got started and we met some people and I was able to then further delegate some of the other stuff like fundraising that again , I did not have time to manage , um , collecting money , collecting , uh , pepperoni sticks and candy bars , turning them in , getting them to people , uh , that I delegated to another parent who , um , very graciously took it on and took that off my plate . Um , and all in all the season was , this was sick . Cess and , um , I again , am looking to be involved with this year , just not to that capacity .",3.666666667,3,3.666666667,4,3.333333333
18,Pd9a27u-b9wysq,"The department I'm currently in is a very , very stressful and demanding department that deals with a lot of customer dissatisfaction and deals with a lot of upset people who have gone through some pretty rough situations . So we burn out staff quite , quite quickly . Um , a good , a good long time for somebody to be in this position is two years and sometimes we get people that lost less than a month because they just , they can't handle the , um , the stresses of the , of the , of the position . So , uh , there was a one time , uh , a few years back where we lost half of our staff within about a six week period that they were , um , it just fell like , like flies . They were , um , they were constantly quitting . So , uh , we ended up having to very much adapt where we all took leadership roles and we all , uh , delegated our work to each other and pretty much was a super tight team and said , you know , to each other , do you have time to do this one or do you have time to take this , this , uh , this client ? Or do you have time to , can you take somebody off my hands because I am , I am just swamped here . So we ended up outsourcing a lot of our , a lot of our work to our coworkers , um , and we all banded together and we made sure that we were all , um , all doing really well . But , uh , it took a leader to , uh , make sure that everybody was still still on the same page and still , uh , mentally handling the , the situation , which was completely , uh , completely stressful . So that's where I stepped up and I , I , I took the role of the , the , the manager of the department , even though we didn't have a manager , there was no extra pay or any , any recognition for it . It was just something that I felt that I needed to do and everyone else was pretty happy that I did that . Um , so that there was delegation roles . Um , we broke up , um , everything that we did and passed it around and , uh , and I just kept track of it in a nice , a nice spreadsheet and left . Let everyone know how everyone was doing and how , how , uh , how they would change in the future if we started to get new staff , which we ended up doing . Okay .","One of the most difficult projects that I had to deal with was rolling out a province wide software package to all the health authorities in the , in the province . I didn't , I wasn't in charge of the entire province . I was just in charge of my health authority and the rollout of the , of the project . So I had to deal with , um , the bureaucracy of the provincial government as well as the bureaucracy of the health authority and the CEO and all the way down from there . Um , and had to make sure that everybody , um , was happy with , uh , with the results of how things , how things got . Uh , the good thing was is that we were all pretty onboard with the software package . It was a very necessary package , so it wasn't a hard sell to , to bring it to the , to bring it to the health authority . It was just , um , getting all the ducks in a row and making sure that everybody was on the same page . Um , the , my , my mantra was always , um , under , under promise and over deliver . So a lot of times I look like a miracle worker because I would say , um , we can , we're only going to do X . And then we gave them X , Y , and Zed . So there was a lot of , a lot of dissatisfaction with that and a lot of people were pretty happy with that , uh , that way because they were , they were not expecting to get such good , good customer service . But these , uh , the steps I had to take were to just to make sure that I knew exactly where we were in the project and I was able to , if anybody needed to ask , I needed to be able to say with certainty where we were going and what were , where , what stage we're at . Um , that took a lot of , uh , communication . It took a lot of , uh , a lot of being on the ground and making sure that everybody was doing the right thing at the right time . So it was quite the , quite the project . Uh , the result was , well , it's , it's , it's rolled out provincially . So , uh , we did , we did something right .","Without getting too much into the nitty gritty of the , of the ins and outs of how to , how this software was , was working and how the users were set up . I was told by the province that a certain type of user was not going to be allowed in the system any longer because it was , if we had too many of these , um , these one offs in the system , then it bogs the system down and makes everything slow . So we were getting rid of everything and putting everybody into templates and making sure that everybody had the , um , the little boxes that they fit in . And there would be no one offs and no weird , weird , weird people that , uh , that got these , uh , outrageous types of a user access . So what happened was I , I got rid of somebody in the , they were given , or they , I took away their access and within about five seconds they were at my desk and they were , uh , threatening to take me to the , to the VP and saying that , uh , you need to , uh , give me back my access . That's how I do my job . I need it done immediately . It needs to be done like right now . Otherwise , otherwise you're going to be here , going to be in a lot of trouble . Um , so I , I had the province at my back , so that was a good thing . Um , but what I ended up doing was I'm a hundred percent customer focused , so I , I called up my , my analyst friends and I said , well , what can I , what can I do to make , make everybody happy here when they , um , gave me a little bit of an out , um , and a little bit of , uh , a little bit of a bonus there and said this person will get , uh , grandfather Dan . But as soon as they leave their position that that access will no longer be there . So don't , uh , don't get them to teach their new to their replacement , how their job is done . It ends with , it ends with them . Um , and so that person ended up retiring a couple of years ago and their , their access did not go to the new person . Um , but , uh , it was , it was a pretty stressful situation cause it was , it was almost instantly after I revoked their access that it was , uh , that they were at my desk being very , very , very , uh , uh , passionate about , um , getting the , their access back , um , threatening me with , uh , with , uh , severe repercussions . So I , I was able to think on my feet and stay customer focused and still , uh , keep a smile on my face and make sure that they were happy at the end of the day . And everybody was , everybody was good at the end .","This was a real tough one . I was doing my , my normal work and I got an email from a VP who was , uh , accusing me of something quite serious and saying that I did not do my job properly and they were , uh , quite upset with me . Uh , they CC'd my VP , my executive director , and my , my manager . So it went to everybody and I looked , uh , I looked pretty , pretty bad , um , in front of everybody . I felt like I was , uh , being , uh , being called out for , for doing , uh , doing my job and uh , doing it improperly . However , um , if you'd scroll down the email just a little bit , there was proof in that email that said that the , um , what I was being accused of was not , uh , possible because there was proof right in that email . If this VP had scrolled down and actually read the entire email , they would have seen that , uh , that there was a proof that , that , that person was , was wrong . Um , so I went up the chain of command and I pretty much talked to my manager and said , uh , what do I , what do I do about this ? I need to , uh , I need to take to clear the air here because this is quite , uh , um , this is quite a serious , serious thing . And this should not have been handled this way . This is a , this is not , not the way it should have been , should have been done . Um , so we both agreed to do a , an education session , uh , with that VP and , and all the people around , um , his area , uh , to say , this is how I do my job and this is how it all works . Um , just basically giving a , uh , an outline of exactly what happens in my , in my job and to make sure that this , uh , this type of , uh , accusation doesn't happen again and it was well received and everybody seemed to understand what , uh , what was going on . So , um , that was , uh , everyone ended up , uh , in a , in a better spot . At the end of it .","When my most recent manager started in her position , she , uh , was tasked with creating a board report , uh , within the first week or so of , of her starting this new , this new job . Um , and so we as a team were pretty , um , pretty supportive and we were very much wanting to make sure that everybody was in a , in a good place . We want to , we are very proud of our team and we want to make sure that we're doing a , uh , a good thing . Uh , what ended up happening was , um , she kept asking for all these reports to be run and , and over and over and over again . Um , and , you know , she would say , Oh , I would like it for 18 months and then , Oh , can you make it for , for two years ? And then it's , it , it was every time she asked that I would have to start all start all over again because that's the way the system works . It would have to start all over again . It was frustrating . It was very , very difficult to , um , to know exactly what she was asking for because she would just ask . Um , I need this report , um , no justification or reason behind it and I need to know why a lot of times , so I can say , well , why don't we do it this way instead ? Or , yeah , that wouldn't work . Or , you know , I've got a suggestion for a different type of report . Uh , what ended up happening was I worked , um , pretty much all night one night because it was just , the time crunch was just so , so crazy . It was , uh , yeah , I was , I think it was started work at two o'clock in the morning or something like that . And we were , we worked all night to make sure that this , uh , this report was out . Um , and the good thing was , is that it was a , a good , a good introduction of our team and our , our commitment to being the best . Uh , but the , the , the good , the other good thing was that we were able to come back and say , um , I was able to say , okay , so now in the future we need to do it this way and this way and this way instead , or I , this is how I prefer to work . Um , I need to know a why before I just go running out and , and start working . Um , and that way it also makes you figure out what you need on your end as well , so you're not just sort of just shotgunning and hoping , hoping for the best . So we ended up getting a pretty , a pretty good idea of who each other were during that . Uh , during that time in the trenches , we were pretty , um , it was pretty intense and it was a very , very stressful time . Um , but , uh , I ended up getting all my work done as well . I think I left early on the Friday or something like that , so , so it , it all worked out really well . But , uh , it was , it was pretty rough and I hope to never do something like that again . That was a , that was a long , long day .",4,3,3.333333333,3.666666667,3
19,Peaxatb-2thcap,"I was doing a project for a client and this client , Uh , They had a number of delays . We were trying to complete a technical deployment . And this client , Uh , I was asked to provide us a list of prerequisites so that we could do our work . Some of it was initial set of prerequisites . Some of it was more ongoing . Um , and so this client had a number of delays on their side . Things took a lot longer than necessary . Um , when we observed that the client was taking a long time to deliver what we needed in order to get our work done , we ended up having a discussion with them . We talked about , uh , what the impact would be on the overall project timeline and the number of hours worked . Uh , we recommended that the client take a hiatus , uh , so that they have sufficient time to get us prerequisites without us having our team . Uh , from consulting hours , the client decided that they would rather continue to burn the hours so that way they would not lose access to the consultants that they had already . And , uh , as a result , um , we encountered a number of delays and basically the project was over time , um , at the end of it . Uh , so , you know , I think we did what we could , uh , by alerting and throwing the red flag when we detected the issue . Uh , but , um , you know , we , we were able to complete the project , uh , and in order to preserve our relationship with the customer , our organization , right . Uh , in recognition that yes , the client has perhaps , um , you know , made a decision that resulted in wasted hours , but we decided to , in order to preserve the relationship , we gave them some free time so that , uh , you know , they wouldn't have to end up paying for more time . Um , the client also put in some investment as well , so it was kind of a shared cost and , um , you know , we were able to finish the deployment successfully .","One time I worked for a customer who was , uh , deploying two new technologies that I had never had any experience with , so they were planning to use Citrix cloud , which is a software that we make . Um , but it's kind of , it's , it's our Citrix hosted product versus the traditional , you know , you buy our software and deploy it yourself . And then , uh , also Azure , which I had never done at that point before . So my goal for myself was , you know , I would have to be sitting in front of the customer and having these design discussions with them . So I ramped up first . Our company provides a number of training courses that allow us to ramp up at any technology . Uh , so I took access to those resources and I went through them as , as fast as I could in order to prepare . I also leveraged a couple of external tools that our company also provides to us . Uh , Pluralsight is one of them regardless . Uh , and then , um , I also looked at some previous deliverables that have been done with both technology types . Uh , so that way I would know what was the framework to be doing , uh , and uh , what to , what types of questions to ask and what not to ask . So as a result of these actions that we were able to have the engagement with the client , and actually I was fortunate because the client actually had another consultant onsite from a third party company that was an Azure expert . And so anytime that I was a little bit fuzzy on the Azure side of things , uh , this expert was able to step in and clarify things . And actually it was a great learning opportunity for me to be able to speak to somebody like that . He had all the certifications . Um , but in the end , we were able to deliver a successful project . It was a design that we did , uh , with Citrix cloud on Azure . We were able to deliver it to the customer . It passed through the quality assurance process , uh , without too many errors . And , uh , you know , we consulted with our architect who was providing oversight at the time . And , um , overall the project was successful , the customer was happy with the results .","One time I was researching a technical issue and according to our own product documentation , um , there was a couple of statements that basically said , uh , configure it in a certain way . Um , this specific technical scenario was configuring folder redirection . And the question was , do we need to configure exclusions when , uh , you have folder redirection configured you at school ? Those folders are not . Several places in our documentation said , yes , you must do not , uh , don't , don't go without it . And then in other places , um , like in blogs , et cetera , uh , it was the exact opposite . And so I had a conflicting information . And so one of the benefits of working at a software company where , uh , we have access to the developers is I am able to reach out to the developers . We use an internal tool Slack . And I posted a question on a Slack channel that is related to the topic I'm talking about . And I was able to have somebody , uh , respond to me fairly quickly . And so in the meantime , I had told the customer that , look , we've found this , we're digging into it . Uh , we don't have a definitive answer yet . Um , and I've reached out to the necessary SMEs internally . I'm hoping to have an answer to you and I've provided a timeline for them . So that way they were aware that progress was being made ultimately . Mmm . I got an answer back from one of the SMEs . He told me basically , um , regardless of what has been posted on there , um , our documentation was actually a little bit out of date . It had not been updated in a while . And actually The , The decision was inconsequential . Uh , there was the technical question . It didn't matter which way you configured it . Um , both things would have the same effect .","I currently have a client that is a large customer and they have been working with our company for a number of years . They are deploying one of our products and basically modernizing their entire environment . It's been a number of years since they invested properly in the right team infrastructure . They identified this as a strategic point of focus . And so , uh , they contracted us to design a environment and then to build it out . Uh , and the Citrix components , the infrastructure components that we built out , that was very straightforward to do . Uh , and really the tricky part where we spent a lot of time and effort was actually taking each one of the workloads that they currently have and figuring out the best way to create it moving forward . So identifying in a given workload which applications need to be carried forward , which ones are not in use and can be replaced , which ones are going to be updated , et cetera . And that actually requires a lot of integration with the clients , application teams and business owners so that they can answer those questions accurately . Right . We're outside experts . We can speak to the Citrix technology , but we can't speak to the actual workloads being delivered . Uh , so we had to work closely with the client . There's a number of images and initially the client had some unrealistic expectations , which , um , I think initially our sales team had validated . Um , so when we came in there and we , we started executing and we observed for the first few images that things were taking a lot longer . Uh , we ran the , uh , we escalated to management and we , we got their attention , let them know , Hey look , this is the timeline we're actually expecting based on how long it's taken for these first two images to build out . This is the projected timeline that it's going to take in order to build out the remaining , you know , eight images or whatever the number was and it's going to far exceed this , uh , March 31st deadline that you have , right ? We're gonna , we're going to be ended up going into September . And the client was actually receptive . They were primarily interested in delivering a quality product . They were well aware that they had under invested in their environment . For a number of years and , uh , they wanted to make sure that when they delivered a new solution , that it was hitting the ball out of the park . Right ? They wanted a home run . They didn't want to deliver something on time , but that was a subpar user experience . And so they adjusted their timelines accordingly . Uh , it was a little bit of a conversation that we had to have , but , uh , the client is now working together with us , and I think we're tightly integrated and we're starting to look at these images in a realistic way .","So one of my yearly goals is to continuously produce technical content that enhances our organization's technical skills . So that can be different things like writing blog articles , producing internal collateral , delivering training , creating training content . And I have to do that at a certain minimum number of times per year . This is in addition to my normal responsibilities of overseeing usually anywhere from five up to 20 technical projects at a time . So the number of projects that I oversee at a given time that tends to wax and wane a little bit with time . Some weeks are busier than others . It just , it all depends . Uh , during one specific point in time , I had a lot of projects . I was overseeing a lot of things that were on my plate . And so as a result , I was not able to do some of these above and beyond technical activities . Um , specifically I have been wanting to contribute and write a blog for some time . Uh , but it seems that , uh , there is a , it seems to conflict with some of my ongoing workload . And of course the ongoing workload is a priority . Uh , keeping our customers happy , delivering successful project outcomes . Uh , so what I ended up usually having to do is put that , uh , above and beyond type of activities on the back burner , wait until there is a bit of a lull , inactivity , and then pick up , uh , when , when that , uh , free time becomes available . Uh , so that's , that's kinda what I have . And because it's more flexible in the above and beyond activities I have to do two per year . Right now at my current job level , uh , I'm able to schedule those with a little bit more flexibility as compared to my existing outstanding customer commitment . So basically what I did at the end of the day is I prioritized , uh , I determined that my customer priorities were number one . And this ongoing technical contribution is number two . I prioritized and I took care of the highest priority first , and then the lower priorities second when I had time permit .",3,3.666666667,3.25,3,3
20,P8z6c6g-6tmgmc,"So throughout company . Throughout my experience working with various companies as a project manager , you always have to deal with a lot of different factors that might be outside of your control . Some of your , uh , teammates might be sick , so that might be busy . The project requirements might change the client customer or the client might have changing requirements . You might be thinking that you're developing something that's out of scope . One time that I had to adjust to one of these changing or complex circumstances was when my lead developer or one of my lead developers had to take some time off due to some parents , some personal family issues . Of course , I made sure that they were very well equipped to feel like they didn't have to feel guilty about leaving this project a critical stage . You know , personal time is obviously very important in times of crisis like this , but because he was the lead , we had to sort of really sort of , um , adjust as quickly as possible in order to make sure that the project got delivered on time and on budget . So I jumped in myself to sort of take on some minor technical tasks . I will not pretend like I have as much experience as my lead developer in terms of , uh , meant to requirements . And I know that me doing something badly might in fact hurt the project because another developer might take some time and I have to correct my mistakes and thus remove some of their own time . So I was able to jump in myself , get some , uh , small tasks that were relatively simple , done and deliver it on time , on budget . And this allowed some of the additional resources that we had on the team to work towards more of the complex situations that the lead developer really had to , uh , was in charge of , but had to take some time off . So as a result , we were able to deliver the project on time and on budget and we were able to sort of overcome this obstacle of having a changing work environment . Um , you know , if you're missing your lead developer . And I had obviously a really big roadblock in terms of getting things done , but we were able to get the project done and , um , able to make sure that everybody's was , uh , very well equipped to making sure that it was okay .","So I remember a time that a client specifically asked us to write a whole new feature for the application that they're developing for something that we had no experience in doing before . So this seemed like it would be way out of our comfort zone . It would have been completely out of scope . And as a result we definitely did not feel like we were ready . But when you just take some time to look at what's actually happening , you need to sort of look at what the aim with the end goal is and then sort of break them down to component parts . Okay , we need to use this framework . Do we have any resources that are available to deal with this framework ? Okay . And maybe this API might be better using this . So once you sort of break them down into those core components , we were able to sort of assign tasks and get a general time on , on what it was able to be accomplished . Was this a realistic timeline ? Um , well , no . Initially it was not realistic timeline , so we had to ask the client to give us an additional time . So I've explained that this is something that , um , we have not had as much practice within the past , but we were confident we could do it . So once we were able to break them down into component parts and then sort of organize that schedule on which component could be delivered , at which time appropriately , then we were able to start slowly building the features and we were able to sort of hit the ground and keep the momentum going . And as a result , we were able to finish the work on the feature . Yes , it was a little bit , um , out of schedule . It was not perfectly on time , but we were able to do it and we were really proud of each other or sort of dealing with this really unexpected situation . And this feature .","So this happens a decent amount in terms of project management because we often have to give out deadlines to our devs and our QA resources in order to make sure that we get the project done . So there was one feature in particular that was really causing a bit of a turmoil in our ranks because we had only a limited amount of gems because some of our other devs were assigned to other places in the company . And , um , we had QE coming and testing and they were able to finish . The dev was able to finish their user story , um , and the kid was able to test all the snares of acuity , notice something that was not really accounted for in the story . And so we had to sort of figure out if this situation was indeed something that needed to be fixed right now at that moment , at that very moment in time , or if it was skipped and , um , or if we could skip it . And the dev sort of said that we could do this , but it would take additional time and that might put us on the back burner . And so he advised us to sort of mention that I was out of scope and that we could visit at Hillier time . Meanwhile , QE said that we need to sort of get the snow men and right now , so I had to go to the client and say , um , we really need to , we really think we should account for this scenario right now . And even though this might take some additional time , we hope that you'll be pleased with the finished project . So I started with three on this , um , and was able to get back to work and deliver it , uh , on the revised timescale , and we were able to get it done .","Work or school ? Huh . Well , um , so there was one issue at work that was the beginning when I first started out as a project management that really thought it was over my head . You know , they really , I really felt like they threw me into the deep end immediately . And um , you know , I was allowed to ask help as needed but as expected to sort of sink into it on my own merit . So that was really high pressure , really stressful . Um , and I didn't know if I could do it , but I just took a step back and looked at each thing that I could do appropriately . Okay , here's this project that we're gonna work on . How can we sort of make sure that it is broken down into easily digestible parts ? I need to talk with this developer , need to talk with this QE . I need to sort of get my mind around each process and sort of start building my relations and sort of being able to express that . I am relatively new to this , but I am eager and willing to learn and I will not be that disappointed in terms of getting some negative feedback or some criticism . I will take that and learn as best as I can . And so I think that's really helped me become a better product manager . Um , so yeah .","So this happens more than I'd like to admit as a project manager . Um , one time I had two meetings that would last several hours at a time and the beginning stage before I learned to properly say no to accepting every single meeting that comes across the desk . I had some issue with keeping a meeting that was discussing my project with other project managers and our overall , uh , director of software . And of course I was also , uh , in the middle of trying to establish good relationship by doing some team building recipe team , building exercises with my team and sort of , uh , making sure that we're all on the same page . So at first I tried to attend every single uh , leadership meeting , but um , because the devs also had other meetings on during their time in rural remote , um , this time was only was the best for also making sure our team workshops were going through . So I had to bow one of the leadership meetings to make sure we could , I can at least attend one or two of the team workshops and sort of build the relationships that way , because I believe it's important to make sure that since you're gonna be working with team moral stopped and you should have a good relationship with them so that communication goes across better . So yeah , once that was done , I was able to sort of fully commit herself back to the team leadership meetings . And I do believe that helped us , um , and to have everything on time and made us a very effective team .",4,2.75,3,2.666666667,2.666666667
21,Pux8xqp-bjb7bk,"Hi there . So at time that I had to adapt , uh , me and my team to a complex situation at work was during the outbreak of the coven 19 , uh , pandemic . Um , approximately two years ago to the date . Um , our team had to go completely remote and we're no longer able to meet back in the office . Um , so I had to quickly adapt procedures , uh , to this new way of working . Um , we were able to get the team , the technology that they needed to be able to work from home . Um , make sure everyone had the internet connectivity , um , the web programs , everything needed to be able to talk and communicate with each other and seamlessly transition from office space work to remote work as our team provided an essential service . Um , we had to continue doing what we do , which is to patrol , aerial gas pipelines . Um , being able to , um , interact with the team over things like WebEx and zoom , uh , being able to put into place , um , a lot of our procedures , um , that were kind of there in case of emergency , such as this one helped the team to succeed and accomplish our tasks . Um , staying compliant , patrolling the entire natural gas pipeline system . Um , each month throughout the pandemic .","So a project which we do is , um , in order to stay compliant with federal regulations is to patrol an entire natural gas pipeline system , um , in a large state out West at least once per quarter . However , we wanted to step it up and show that we're going above and beyond with our patrol duties . So we made it a goal to patrol the entire pipeline network at least once per month . Uh , meaning we were becoming compliant three times per quarter instead of just once , which was required . In order to do this , we had to , uh , restructure the routing of our pipeline patrols , which was done from fixed wing aircraft as well as helicopters , um , using GIS to plan the most efficient routes . But the one thing that made it a real challenge is dealing with weather , which is completely unpredictable . So what this meant was trying to structure our days where if we got ahead of schedule , we could quickly download the files necessary , load them up into our sensor equipment and move on and start controlling additional areas . What this did was be able to speed up our process and take advantage of the sunny , clear weather days that we needed . Meaning that if we got stuck with , you know , rainy days , um , we would still be on schedule because we were able to , um , be extra efficient , uh , on the days when we got more done than we thought we would be able to , we would be able to move on to the next day's work , um , geographically speaking and get more done that day . So that the days that we weren't able to fly , we could still stay on target . So what this meant is we are now able to patrol the entire pipeline system once per month or three times per quarter , going above and beyond the federal compliance regulations , meeting our boss's goals and making the company as well as our clients and customers on the ground happy and feel safer .","A time I had to , um , make a quick decision based on conflicting information occurred approximately one year ago for our natural gas pipeline patrols . We use both fixed wing aircraft like airplanes as well as rotary aircraft or helicopters . Helicopters cost much , much more . Um , I believe about 10 times more , uh , cost per flight to do the patrols as the fixed wing helicopter . However , of course the helicopter is able to , uh , perform better in urban areas than the fixed wing aircraft . Uh , due to the nature of the layout of the natural gas pipelines . In this case , uh , we had a plane that went down , uh , due to mechanical reasons and it was of course promise to us that the aircraft would be up and running the following day . Uh , we were getting close to our deadline of completing , um , a complete patrol of the system for that quarter and since we had an achieved it yet , it was , um , very important that we get it done . Of course , um , we contract out the work , uh , between the aircraft , the fixed wing aircraft and the helicopter . So they're almost , um , competing , you know , to get more work from us , um , as they're both individual , uh , contractors . So of course I have to take into account the fixed wing . People are telling me it's okay , it's okay . Um , the plane's going to be fixed , it's going to be good to go tomorrow . Um , meanwhile I got the helicopter , uh , outfit telling me , uh , you know , we could , we could do this , we could get this done . Um , don't , don't worry about it . So I had to make the decision , you know , do I trust that the plane is going to be ready and available tomorrow , um , possibly saving us our company thousands of dollars in patrol costs or should I go ahead and schedule the helicopter knowing that they're ready , um , and they're going to be able to fly and get the work that we need to get done done . Um , so what I did , I decided to , you know , money isn't really an object in this case . Um , it's more important that we get the patrols done as necessary . So we went ahead and scheduled the helicopter to do the following days , patrols , regardless of if the plane was going to be ready or not . Um , this had the potential of saving us , um , tens of thousands of dollars in fines , um , for not being compliant , um , doing a complete patrol the system for the month . So even though it costs us a bit more to get the , uh , helicopter patrol in and done , as opposed to waiting for the fixed wing to be fixed , if it was even going to be fixed , um , I think it was the right decision because in the end , um , we kept everyone safe and we saved the company , um , potential money , uh , by not getting fined . Even if you know , it costs a little bit more for that day's operations .","A time I had to deal with a stressful situation at my work , um , occurred when one of my employees who I had assigned to patrol for that day , uh , was unable to make it in due to a last minute , uh , illness . Um , so I had a couple of options . I could either scramble , um , polo at an employee off of another scheduled , uh , patrol that I think could have been done at a later time . Or what I went ahead and decided to do was go ahead , jump in and do the patrol myself . Um , even though I'm a manager , I still feel like I should have the skills to do what I'm asking my employees to do . So I was able to jump on in there and , uh , get the job done without having to effects anyone else or anyone else's schedule , uh , and cover for that employee . It was stressful . Of course , it took me probably longer than it would my regular employees because of course , being the manager , I still have to deal with the day to day operations , uh , answering emails and making sure that everyone's on task and getting done what they need to get done . But knowing the situation , I worked with the pilot , we were able to take our time , go a little bit slower , um , you know , get , get down to a low altitude where I could get some cell coverage , make the emails and texts as necessary , um , as I needed to throughout the day , but also go up and get the flight done , patrol the pipeline , and stay on schedule .","At my job besides , uh , making sure that we stay compliant by patrolling of the natural gas pipelines within the system , uh , once per quarter or in our case once per month . Um , we also take on additional tasks of high importance , uh , when there's a gas pipeline construction work going on in order to protect the integrity of the remaining pipes . Uh , basically what this means is as one pipeline is taken out of service , it puts more pressure on another set section of the system . If something were to happen to that section of the system . Um , well another section is being worked on . It could cause a catastrophic failure and leave , uh , hundreds of thousands of customers without the gas they need both residential and industrial . So what I had to do , um , was instead of attend an important training session , um , in which case I was giving a presentation about some of the safety , uh , protocols and training that we do within our team , um , to help others out . I had to go ahead and pull myself off of that and get back in the office and , uh , design how we were going to handle this , uh , surprise construction project that required us to patrol this additional pipeline area , um , daily , almost 24 , seven during working hours to protect the integrity of the pipeline . But what I was able to do was pull in , uh , one of my most respected employees who , um , I feel like , um , is really showing you know , leadership potential . And I was able to , you know , brief him a little bit , uh , give them , you know , a little bit of a training on how I would respond to questions and answer and answer them at this training seminar . And he was able to go and do it for me and it actually worked out well . Um , I was able to get the work done I needed to and he was still able to , uh , do the training seminar that I was supposed to do . So even though I got pulled off , one thing , I was able to delegate and having another employee do it for me so I could get the more important tasks done .",3.333333333,3.75,4.333333333,3.666666667,3.666666667
22,P5uwhxc-gf5gjm,"So I was working in a school district and it was the second year that I had been working in the school district and a lot of new teachers were hired to replace some of the old retired teachers . Also , the superintendent wanted us to be a little bit more efficient and keep better records of our ticketing system . And we're also implementing like several new projects during that second year . And it was a lot more challenging to be able to get everything done and actually learn how the new products work because the teachers would always have questions with how the stuff works . So I had to make sure that I was knowledgeable about the products . I didn't have to know like every specific feature , but I had to make sure I knew how it works , how to fix it . And that second year was a little bit more stressful because the superintendent wanted us just to be , um , more aware of power or budgeting our time and making sure that we were just keeping the school district , um , efficient with our technology needs .","So I had actually just started working at a small manufacturing company and they were going through some major computer problems and one of the issues they were having was their email just wasn't working correctly and the server was very inefficient . It was all , it was outdated and I knew that I had to move them to something else so I created a project to move them to email in the cloud through office three 65 the problem was is that I had to make sure that I've backed up all their emails and then transfer it to the cloud and not really having a ton of experience with this process made this a lot more challenging . But I ended up watching videos when I was at home after work and researching . Different people have done this process and I made sure that I was making progress to complete the task and making sure that once they were migrated to this new system , they would have better access to email . And it just , it took a little while , but I made sure that I was making steady progress each day and made sure that I was keeping everyone up to date and I made sure that the CFO was happy once I completed this process .","I was working for a manufacturing company and over the weekend I went to go remote into the server , uh , cause I wanted to run a backup . And when I couldn't promote it in a server , um , I noticed that something was wrong . So even tried the diagnostic utility , which is another way to log into the server remotely . And that didn't work either . So when I got to work the next day , I noticed that the server completely off . Uh , none of the lights were on . Even the diagnostic , uh , led on the front of the server was off and you can try different hours and nothing work . So I started to go to Google and just looked up different solutions and some of them were just replaced the motherboard , others were replace the memory and some were just replaced the power supply . For some odd reason , I just decided the power supply seems to make sense just based on the condition on the server and just how replacing other stuff just seemed to be more expensive and would just take too long . So I ended up quickly ordering a replacement power supply . And when I plugged a new power supply and the next day server put it up , had I gone with the other solutions , the server probably will , would have been down for longer . So just picking the power supply , which seemed to make the most sense , was a good solution for me to come up with . I don't think any of the other solutions would have , uh , been valuable and just wasted time . So I just tried to make , uh , the solution based on like reasoning was why I picked the power supply and one of the other solutions that people have suggested .","So I was working at a school district and my boss decided to , I knew install a service pack from an email server and the service pack installation failed , which meant that for a little while the school didn't have any email solutions and the superintendent wasn't happy because he didn't have access to email . So I had to come up with a solution just so he can access his email . It wasn't going to be ideal until we had the server fully fixed . But I had to come up with a solution that would allow him to check his email through the web portal , which was still on an access to his email , but it wouldn't be able to use Alec because that feature wasn't working at the time . So I remember going to Google and finding all sorts of different solutions added . There's really quickly , because I didn't want him to be without email for a long period of time , and I was able to actually find a solution that was able to get the email resolved within the next , uh , 30 minutes after implementing it . So the superintendent was able to stock this email . It wasn't really that happy that , um , he had used the web portal . There were some warning messages that would pop up you to do is click OK and they would go away . So once again to the email set up , um , and it was fully functional throughout the entire district , um , just how to make sure that we were still going to follow through and get the server fully operational . But it was extremely stressful because the superintendent really wanted his email . And , um , the , uh , boss that I had could have actually got his contract , um , removed because , um , the superintendent wouldn't have access to his email . So just making sure that everyone , that the school district that was going to be there during the summer , um , during the 4th of July weekend would be able to access through email .","Okay . So I was actually working at the manufacturing company , um , for several years and I had mentioned to a coworker , um , a previous week that I could help her on a Monday with a project she needed help with . It just so happened on that Monday that in the middle of the day , um , a thunder storm came through and knocked up the power and the computer and our shipping department had actually failed . Um , the hard drive actually crashed even though the computer was on a battery backup . Something happened with the hard drive during this , uh , thunderstorm , which meant that I had to replaced the hard drive and I had to go buy a new hard drive and drive somewhere and then come back with hard drive . It meant that I wouldn't be able to help my coworker with her , uh , project that I had specifically set time aside on that Monday . And my coworker was understanding . She knew that the shipping department needed to get their computer operational because if we can't ship products out , the company is not going to be able to make money . So , um , she understood the situation . I explained to her that I can help her the next day . Um , the installation of the hard drive and the , um , operating system installation shouldn't take that long . So , um , once I , um , explained to her what the situation was and explained to her like how long this might take , she understood and I was able to , um , help her the next day . Um , I just felt bad because I really wanted to help her that Monday , but I didn't think of thunderstorms going to come through and knock out a hard drive in a shipping computer was on a battery backup .",2.666666667,3,3.333333333,3,3
23,P6957vv-2bnyf3,"One of the most complex environments at work recently has been the COBIT 19 pandemic , which has completely changed the services that we offer and of course how we offer them . And in the library setting we are very much focused on in-person programming and focused on how we can bring people into the library . Well , because of COBIT , everything went virtual and that completely changed the nature of what we were able to do . So there was virtually nothing that we could offer in-person . So the entire operation was turned upside down and the most difficult thing was figuring out how we could offer programs that were most similar to what we had already been offering . So that required us looking specifically at each program and asking ourselves , okay , how can we do a craft program online ? How can we do a book club online ? How can we do a genealogy program online ? And it was very difficult because we had never faced anything like this before , but we just took each program one by one and decided how it could be best translated into a virtual program . And in some cases that was easy . We had a book club and that was very easily translated to a virtual environment . However , a craft program is much more difficult of course . So we would have a live craft tutorial and in the weeks beforehand we would pass out physical kits through our drive through services that people could take with them and we would tell them on this date we have the live craft tutorial . So we were incorporating as much in person , as much of the in-person benefits as we could to the craft program . And of course it was not the perfect solution . It did not work well for many of our patrons who many of them are older and they're used to coming in person and doing everything in person . They're not comfortable with the computer . But overall and throughout the pandemic , it became a success because we were able to so quickly change what we were doing and so closely know as much as we could match what we had matched , what we had provided before .","One of the most difficult projects that I've had recently is a system wide book tournament , which that includes 20 branches and it is aimed towards young adults . And the goal is for over a period of months , young adults too . We'll be reading 12 books and they will answer questions and a at a , at a future tournament of both virtual and in person to win prizes like a Kindle , a gift card . Um , so the prizes are relatively , um , quite the incentive for the teams . And so my job was to coordinate the book party at my branch , but also to coordinate the final championship with the other branches , which was difficult in part because I hadn't done it before . The person who had been in charge of it last year was no longer at that location , so it suddenly fell to me to organize all of that . So it , it was difficult also because I had to coordinate numerous teens over a period of about four months with only a meeting once every month . So getting their attention was difficult and keeping their attention was even harder . So the first thing I did was plant on my schedule when each book party would be in , when the championship was . And after that I knew that it would be difficult to get to maintain their attention and their focus because reading 12 books while they have a busy schedule was not easy . So they , they , I knew they needed to be reminded . So after I set the dates for the parties and the championship , I filled in times that I thought would be best to contact them and I ended up contacting them twice a month in between parties , which seemed to work very well . And I was , would send them example questions from the championship . I would randomly quiz them . Basically I was trying to keep their attention in between all of the , all of the monthly meetings . And , um , another goal that I had was to make each book party fund , even though there weren't prizes for each party . So each , I planned each thoroughly weeks in advance so that each party was an event . So , even though it wasn't , you know , you don't want prizes because it's not the championship , but it still has that , Oh , I went to an event feel and it ended up going really well . We had 12 total participate from my branch and coordinating it with the other branches went smoothly . We had some in person , we had some virtual and everyone had a good time and they definitely seem like they're going to be coming back next year .","The situation in which I received conflicting information happened with the book tournament fourteens and it had to do with the marketing for the event . So the organizers , the original organizers told us , you will use our , our flyers , our posts , you will use our information to market this program because we have everything already made . And unfortunately , um , one of the other librarians who had been doing do , who had been participating in the tournament of books since it had begun , she had a different opinion on how the program should be marketed . And part of the reason was because she knew her target audience , she knew what they would best respond to . And so she was , she has a lot of seniority because she has been there a while and she now manages a branch . And so I didn't want to ignore her , but I didn't want to ignore the original organizers even though we were given a lot of autonomy , we were told to expressly use these resources . And so I received the information from the manager of , Oh , we can advertise however we want , here's a better way to advertise . And then we had the organizers saying , you know , only use this now it would seem obvious that you go by the original organizers and what they have said to do . But part of the problem is that this event was entirely voluntary . We didn't have to put on this program for the teens . So in the sense of it being voluntary , you don't know whether or not you have to stick with everything or can you pick and choose . And that was a big debate . And eventually , um , I brought up the question in a meeting saying , I know that we have these , these marketing resources , but can we supplement these with others ? And apparently a lot of people had actually had that question but hadn't yet brought it up . So multiple people chimed in saying that they would like to advertise different things or advertise in another way . So we ended up being allowed to use whatever marketing materials we wanted as long as we kept the main banner and all of those materials . So we were better able to market based on our target audience while still following the regulations that were put in place . By the original organizers .","Very recently , my , the coworker that I worked most closely with announced that she was resigning to follow a different career , but she only gave us a few days and also those few days or right before the next month . So for the way we plan programs , the first of the month is always a very important date because it marks a new stage of planning for the month after that . And there are very , um , close due dates for many of the things we have to submit from marketing . So it was very tricky to suddenly lose hat . Most of my help , all a lot of help , um , on a such a very short notice and she was not able to get all the materials that she would have typically needed in time . So it ended up falling on me to , to finish a lot of what had normally been her work . So the first thing I did was create , um , get a full list of everything that I needed to do and Mark on the due dates . I didn't have a lot of time to organize it because I was down to a number of days , but I quickly took everything off my schedule that I didn't absolutely need to do and I worked solely in priority order . What I needed to do from that list that I created . So I had to create marketing images first for example , and then I had to write the press release next and I followed everything down the due date . I'm doing as little as I could around that so I could get these things done that absolutely needed to be done . And I did make it , I barely made it because it was a lot of work , but I was able to get it in in time and I was , I had to use time after that to catch up on my other work , but it was more manageable than trying to do that other work while I was getting , getting done with those projects that had those close due dates . So fortunately it did work out . I think maybe what I would do next time is try to enlist the help of a fellow employee if they were not particularly busy . Um , it , it is often acceptable in the workplace that I am in to ask for help if you are overwhelmed . But I was part , part of my line of thinking was that I would have to explain , I would have to take more time to explain to them what I needed . That would be helpful . But I think I would , I think I would reconsider that judgment call next time so that I could get things done sooner and not so much would be backed out .","I had promised to help a coworker with one of their programs . But what happened is that they had to reschedule their program and when they rescheduled it , put it very close to a meeting that I'd had with an outside , you know , individual . And that meeting was very important and could not be rescheduled . I was , um , basically performing outreach to another organization that could hopefully bring in more library patrons . So outreach is very important for our library . So I absolutely could not miss that . And not only that , I didn't want to rush her when I was speaking to her or it , I didn't want it to even seem that I was rushing her because it was very important that she knew she had my full attention in that moment and that I was genuinely interested in working with her . But I had promised that I would help with that program . And because of the setup and the cleanup and the nature of the program , I knew my coworker was still going to need a lot of help . So what I did in that case was I asked another coworker if they could fill in for the first 15 minutes because that's when I estimated that's , that's the amount of time I estimated that the meeting would run over just in case . I did explain to the employee that I thought that my meeting would end soon enough . I did impress upon them how important it was to me that I do this meeting properly . So they agreed to do 15 minutes rather than take over completely because I didn't think that would have been fair to ask . So they took that first 15 minutes and I also met the employee that I was helping know that I might run a little late , but I have someone else who can help . And they were okay with that , you know , fortunately because they , it , it , it worked well with the schedule that the other employee would help . And it was , it was difficult to , to do that meeting while I was thinking about getting back to the other program . But I just forced myself to set that aside and do one thing at a time , because ultimately I couldn't be in two places at once , so I had to devote all my attention to the meeting and we actually ended up getting done a little bit early . Um , but I focused all my attention on the meeting and then as soon as I could , I got back to the program and I was able to get there ahead of time and help set up and both the program and the meeting went very , very well .",3.666666667,4,3.333333333,3.666666667,4.333333333
24,P2wqbum-fh3m8h,"Um , when I worked at a digital marketing agency , um , our , um , company went through a restructuring , um , and unfortunately many of my coworkers were like , Oh , um , I was fortunate to not be one of those people . Um , and , um , as an account manager , everyone who remained , how to take on the clients of everyone who was no longer with the company . Um , so I had to take on several new clients , including clients and industries that I was not familiar with . Um , so I'd take on a manufacturing , uh , company , a company in the medical research field , both of which were extremely technical and complicated , um , you know , industries to , to be working with and to be creating content with . But , you know , I , I did a lot of research . I , um , looked through all of the documentation of everything that we had created for them in the past with the former account managers . And , you know , I got up to speed as quickly as I could . Um , and everything turned out pretty well . It took a little bit of time . And , um , luckily they were pretty , um , flexible and you know , they , they were pretty accommodating of me .","Um , I recently took on client and I was tasked to , um , run an advertising campaign for them . They had previously worked with , um , someone else who , uh , ran an advertising campaign with them . I hadn't looked in their account . I wasn't aware of , you know , what the former , um , ad manager , uh , had done for them . Um , but they told me what their conversion and their click through rates were with their former ad manager . Um , and without knowing really much about whether or not I could approve upon that , um , I set a goal basically doubling both those conversion rates and click through rights . Um , I needed to be able to do that in order to sign the client . Um , so it took a lot of work , but within a month , um , I was able to achieve that goal and , um , we actually exceeded it . Um , yeah .","So , uh , I recently went through a rebrand with one of my clients , um , where our agency was essentially responsible for redesigning , uh , the company's entire , you know , logo , uh , the general aesthetic of , of their brand . And then we were also , um , redesigning the website . Um , so for this project , you know , the , the first thing that we started with was the logo . Um , so , you know , after meeting with my client and finding out what it was that they were looking for , I met with my graphic designer and relate that information . Um , and she created a logo . Um , when she sent the logo over to me , I was kind of aware that the client wasn't going to like it . Um , I didn't want to tell my designer that , but when I brought it to the client , that is indeed what happened . Um , there were new clients , so it was kind of scary . But , um , basically I , you know , I , I worked with the client . Um , I worked with necrotic designer . Her feelings were hurt . It was kind of a messy situation . Um , eventually we did come to an agreement . And really the branding and the logo , the website redesign , everything was so much more simple than , um , what it was exactly that , you know , my , my graphic designer came , came with in the beginning . Um , so , you know , in the end everyone was happy .","I recently took on a leadership role on my organization where essentially , um , I was tasked with doing a lot of additional , um , heading a positional projects in addition to , um , you know , the , the normal tasks and responsibilities of my job . Um , so basically leadership position was as , um , as the head of our new , um , basically text solutions . Um , it's not exactly a department , but , um , it's a sector within our organization that was created in order to basically streamline the integration of technology across all of our various systems . Um , so I , you know , really had to balance my , my main role , um , with all the demands of the new , you know , tech integration and basically how I did that as I tried to , um , I tried to use , you know , those , those new tech solutions , um , in ways that would not only streamline my job but streamline everyone's chops across the company . Um , but in , by doing that , I actually was able to take a lot of the manual work that I was doing each week , um , take that away . And I was able to manage both very effectively .","So I recently took on , um , basically the side hustle of running an Etsy shop in which I sold , um , digital products . So things like , um , spreadsheets that help you with budgeting and things of that nature . Um , and basically I just did it to make a little bit of extra side income . Um , I wasn't really aware of how time intensive it was going to be since it was all digital products , products . Um , so , you know , once the shop was live , um , I realized that it was getting a lot of customer communication , um , all day long , the potential customer communication , asking questions . Um , and also I was getting a lot of current customers , so people who actually purchased those digital products . Um , they needed a lot of guidance along the way that I hadn't built in in the outset . So it really was affecting , you know , my , my work and , um , I just had to do everything after work hours and it was really difficult in the beginning . But basically I really focused on optimizing all of the communication , um , that I had with any , uh , new customers or current customers in regards to the digital products . I made sure that the instructions were crystal clear and I doing that , um , I was able to really improve my shop's rating in addition to just include improving customer satisfaction in that shop . And I reduced the number of questions I was getting by probably 95% . So I no longer had to attend to those , um , questions . And it really became hands off from there .",2.333333333,2.333333333,1.666666667,3.333333333,3.333333333
25,Pgb2wak-54xtr6,"Alrighty . So within the last year or so at our current company where I'm working as a sales executive at a computer software company , uh , we've recently rolled out a new complex tool that basically takes all the different data sources that a specific individual client partner is using and aggregates them together into a single data warehouse . And this is really complex and changing because as we've kind of said it , we're kind of , um , implementing while flying the plane at the same while trying to , we're trying to find the plane while trying to build at the same time . So , uh , with that , there's a lot of issues in terms of timelines , priorities , needs that haven't been taken into account . So one way for me to really take a step back and ensure that we're looking for the right outcomes is , um , uh , getting trained and be a better understanding or tool to be able to , uh , support our , um , our client partners to the best of my ability . And then also being able to step back and coordinate with our client partners to determine what are the priorities in terms of their outcomes and goals and priorities so we can work backwards and ensuring that we're following through and providing the most amount of value for our tools that they're expecting . So in the end , I was able to get up to speed with the tool . Our clients were able to meet their priorities and goals within the , um , within their prioritization , and we were able to , uh , continue on with increasing our client satisfaction , um , productivity . So on .","So a time where I had to set goals for a project that was hard to achieve was , so currently , again , I'm working , I've been working full time for the last 17 plus years , um , at a medical software company . So along with my full time job and having three kids , I've been trying to complete my bachelor's as well . So being able to set a quantifiable and realistic goals in terms of the timelines based upon the credits and requirements that would need to complete my , um , bachelor's of arts and being able to work back so that , uh , I can build in buffer room for any life events and such , like , like , uh , the pandemic so that I have a clear and concise timeline with , um , sub goals that are attainable and quantifiable , um , towards my progression . So to be able to achieve this , I had to understand what the , um , milestones were , uh , working towards the finish line and then taking a step back in terms of a realistic timeline to determine how I would actually be able to tackle all those . So , um , as a result , I was able to more , uh , realistically come up with , um , a timeframe and a goal to actually hit and meet and achieve and complete my bachelor's .","Alrighty . So most recently we onboard a new client in the middle East . And , um , as part of this , um , I wasn't assigned the account , but I was being told to start booking meetings with the individual . So just gain a lot of conflicting information from my supervisor as well as our sales team in terms of who was actually going to take on this client and implement it . So what I was finally able to do is get all the key parties , my supervisor and the sales team on a phone call and be able to , to actually clarify what is my expectation of what is the final decision in terms of what's happening with this client , so that I can easily and actually follow through with what is being asked . So in this call where it will talk about our car timelines , priorities , capacities , and all the such , um , to be able to determine what's going on and actually then be able to reach out to the client and confirm that I will be taking it , I will be booking a time to meet with them and start moving this implementation forward . So as a result , uh , internally , we're able to resolve and communicate and clarify the situation as well as get back to the client to start implementing and getting their solution set up .","So within the last year or so , we've been making a lot of sales and that means a lot of implementations or someone like myself who's a customer success manager at a medical software company working through and , um , helping our clients onboard and get value out of our solutions . So , um , in the last year or so was a very high pressure and stressful because of the amount of work and , uh , priorities . And it seems like my clients are snowballing at the right times where everyone wants , um , support or assistance , uh , at the same moment . So in this situation , I was able to understand what our client's timelines and priorities were , being able to write them all down on a piece of paper to determine , um , what's the amount , what's my approach , or what's my order of prioritization ? And then being able to work through those , um , one at a time to be able to more easily manage . I was also able to ask for additional resources for help and support to be able to meet some of these outcomes with the resources that we had within our team . So ultimately I was able to distress , uh , remove some of the pressure , offload some of the tasks with resources that we have within our team and be able to get back to our clients in a timely manner while also being able to communicate transparently to keep them satisfied and content .","So , I mean this is all about this work life balance . So once again , as a sales executive in a medical software company , um , I've experienced difficult to keep a commitment that I made to my partner in charge of taking her to the eye doctor for a preliminary exam for a laser eye surgery . So in this case I had a conflict in terms of work meetings and the ability to take the day off to so that I can fulfill this commitment that I would promise to my partner . So in this case I was able to coordinate and ensure that uh , I had Frank discussions with both my work and my partner and be able to prioritize what was the most important matter . And this case , my , my partner was able to see that because this was just a preliminary exam . She was contented with going herself . So I was able to meet my work commitments , but I had to make a promise and a commitment to ensuring that I would have the time off booked and be available for the actual day of the surgery to provide better supporting care for my partner while also being able to , um , ensure that my work commitments were being met in an adequate time .",3,2.25,3.333333333,3.666666667,3
26,Puqu6bq-ezubuc,"Hello . Well , particularly as a project manager , I think like many others , we've had to adopt to a situation where work has become virtual . Um , and so in place of face to face meetings or even working next to each other in an office environment where using video and email and collaborative tools in order to communicate . And that can be challenging , particularly when you're in an open webinar or something of those sorts . And people don't necessarily understand how to manage stopping speaking and letting others speak their minds . So you become a kind of facilitator to keep the conversation on track . And over time you learn to set some rules of engagement before you enter into these things . So tight agendas and methods of , uh , answering the necessary questions and avoiding too much sidetracking .","Hi . Okay . I'm remembering a time when we had a very ambitious development timeframe to bring a new product that was web based to market and the programming team was largely overseas in India . So , um , one of the first realizations is cultural , uh , in that there are many days that Indian workers take off that wouldn't fit on our standard calendar in the U S um , and another was having to adjust to time differences for all the people in the group and trying to optimize the time when we would be good to , uh , set meetings and do follow ups and those sorts of things . We ended up doing a lot of things on paper for project tracking and an open forum where people could come in and write down their status and communicate any problems so that we minimize the need to meet on a , on a video chat as much as possible and use that time almost in a scrum , like way to set new goals , remove roadblocks , and we'd had a chance to already see what those issues might be so that we could , uh , keep things moving despite different timeframes and calendars .","Hello . Well , in my work I'm an instructional designer working in e-learning , which is what pastes draining and often and and a particular instance , which I'm thinking of now , you run into a situation where different stakeholders have different ideas about what learners need to know in order to perform a certain task . And in one situation in which I was not a project manager that I'm thinking about , these came in written form and nobody collated them . So I had to decide how to handle different ways to take the content in a storyboard , which is what my deliverable is . I ended up deciding I would use collaborative word functionality . So I would put in the answer that made the boasts the most sense to me based on the edit together with a live comment saying , here is what another reviewer said . So it ended up being a pretty cluttered document with that going on , but it was understandable and therefore we were able to have discussions during the next meeting and very quickly get to the points where there were differences in opinion .","Hello ? Well this is a good one . Now usually in my field we work on a set of deliverables that moves from something simple to something more complex . So for example , you start with what's called a design doc , which is more or less an outline of what you intend to do and what outcomes you hope to achieve . And then you take that to increasingly more complex storyboards that almost look like movie storyboards . So at one point in the project I'm now thinking of , there was a turnover in staff and somebody brand new came into the project at a late storyboard stage and decided that they wanted to change some of the very basics of construction that should have been managed and handled by this particular client way up at the design document stage . This was challenging because we always work with deadlines and I had to really hold my irritation and I ended up listening to what this gentleman had to say . And as it turned out , I agreed with some of those points . So it was one of those occasions where you sort of hold onto your , uh , your sense of integrity to the project , relax your ego , listen and see what you can bring to it . I tried to minimize the impact to other parts of the project while adding some of the best of that feedback through a gentle tailoring versus a whole rewrite . And this particular subject matter expert was thrilled . The overall client was happy enough and I lost a little money , but I think I ended up with a better solution .","Hello . Well actually this happens quite often in the career of instructional design , particularly when you have multiple clients . So , uh , uh , usually you can juggle it into uh , portions of your day . But in this case , uh , my client was a contractor themselves who had two different client projects and I was working with them on both of those . So it's a case in which you really have to delve into priorities . The way that I was able to handle it is due to um , the nature of the work where there are deliverables . So instead of working on and those deliverables increase over time , so it's possible that you know , a small piece and then move on to a small piece in the other project and sort of keep things rolling with review time in between . So by staggering the schedule and not having everything start on exactly the same day , I could , for example , do the design document part of project one , submit that to the first client and then do a kickoff meeting and do a design document for them . Well , the first project was under review , not my favorite way to work whatsoever . I prefer to just stick with one thing , but when it happens , I realized it's possible to manage it .",2.666666667,3,3,4,3
27,Psrjfhz-3mbi8s,"Okay . So at time I had to adapt to a changing or complex environment at work . It's a pretty relatable one , I think . So these start up the Kovac pandemic , uh , in March of 2020 , uh , we have an in person and online component of the business that I work at . And you know , our in person , uh , events were shut down , um , immediately we had to switch to wait to figure out how to work uh , remotely or virtually sort of at a moment's notice . Uh , so what we did , or what I did was I shifted all of our work , uh , from in-person to online . And the way I was able to do that was just taking advantage of resources that are available in our industry . So rather than having in person auctions and estate sales , we were able to shift those to virtual platforms online . So we would use a site called high bid for example , to host auctions . And that allowed us to continue , uh , to maintain ourselves level and actually increased our sales level by , uh , switching to online . And then we're actually able to reduce cost , um , as well and increase our profits by just , uh , more people were able to see those auctions to see those estate sells . So again , we had to take an , you had to take an uncertain , uh , time period . Our traditional business model was up ended due to , uh , you know , government , local and state restrictions on in-person gatherings . So took the time to do the research to start that thing more , uh , online platforms that could substitute those in person events . And those have worked out so well that while now we've resumed in person events , we are doing more through those virtual platforms and it's actually resulted in a higher number of sales . We're able to hold , uh , more amounts overall . So in a lot of ways it's been a real blessing in disguise looking for a silver lining , despite the challenges that the pandemic , we were able to embrace those challenges and adapt our business , uh , to sort of meet the needs of the moment .","Okay . So at time I had a project that the goals were hard to achieve and the steps I took to reach those goals . Uh , so with the business that I run , uh , you know , we initially sold only through sort of e-commerce and then decided we wanted to expand , uh , to sort of in person events and didn't have any experience doing that . Wasn't sure we had the staffing , uh , to do that as well . Uh , but I knew we could make a lot more money , have a lot more clients if we took that approach . And so what I did was went to a lot of our competitors sales and sort of saw what was working well for them . What was it , where were there some inefficiencies ? Uh , just looking to learn overall sort of what we could , what , what we can learn from them and sort of adapt on our own , uh , to sort of host our own , uh , our own in person events . And so just learning from that , you know , what I did was able to , I took out a working capital loan so I could hire a couple of additional people , uh , for help . That was a bit of a gamble for short , uh , taking out a loan like that . And I hire people who've had a little bit of experience working in auctions and estate sales , uh , previously . Uh , so it was able to get the , get the help that I needed , uh , learned how to advertise . Uh , those events sort of learned what worked well in terms of advertising , uh , learn what , you know , how many days they should be held , sort of when to discount items and so forth . And you know , there were a few hiccups initially you kind of have to learn by doing ultimately . Uh , but you know , proud to say that was , uh , a big expansion of our business and it worked out well . So we switched from , you know , a small online only business initially , uh , to selling in , in person . Uh , advancement is worked out well for us . Uh , for a pre coven , we were starting to do as much business online as we were , are filled me in person as we were online . So it was very satisfied , uh , with the results that we've kind of , we had to tweak it as we go . Like I said , it wasn't a , wasn't a smooth process entirely , but very satisfied with the decision I made . And then the risk to make that expansion .","Okay . So a time when I had to make an important decision quickly was had a perspective client approach our business about wanting to do an estate clean out . Uh , that's something we do is someone is moving or we're downsizing , uh , have a relative die come in and clean out the continents or their house and sort of resell those items for profit . And had a daughter , uh , of , uh , someone who had a large house and owned a record store business and the house was in foreclosure and they had been ordered essentially to vacate , uh , they house within about a week . And you know , a turnaround time of that quick is very challenging . And she was going to approach some other companies about doing this as well . Uh , but the challenge was I had heard as I was starting to research whether it's will be profitable for us , that the house had been quote unquote picked over that , you know , some of the record collection had , had been sold to other collectors already and so forth . So what's that going to be getting sort of the , the leftovers , was this going to be profitable for us ? So , you know , I was able to spend a couple of hours at the house , do some , some basic research of what was still there . Uh , took the time to reach out to some colleagues who specialize in , uh , the selling of bottle records and so forth , what they thought would be a , you know , a fair price for the collection . And I was able to take that information and then approach , uh , approached the daughter and said , you know , we'd be glad to help you out . I think I could make this work . But you know , given the tight time frame and the uncertainty about whether this collection had been picked through or not , you know , I can't offer you the price that you won't for the collection . And , and she understood that and she also , you know , she was between a rock and a hard place . She needed to get this done . So I was able to sort of take advantage of the , of the urgency of the situation actually come up , benefit to get the collection for , you know , for a much lower price . I was very confident in the research that I had done , all the records that they did have , and sort of the experts that I spoke with it to get the collection at an affordable price and still make a very healthy profit . Uh , and we , we did make a healthy profit . Uh , we actually turned around the collection , uh , pretty fast . We got the , the house cleaned out even quicker than I anticipated , so it was , uh , a bit of a , a risk . It was , uh , an educated risk , I think what the research that I did , but I was very satisfied with the profit margin , uh , that , that we made . Overall . It was definitely something I was pleased I made that decision .","Okay . So a time I had to cope with a high pressure or stressful situation at work . Uh , so we do in person auctions and estate sales , uh , at my company . And we had a sale coming up , uh , one , uh , Saturday and Sunday , typical weekend sale essentially . And on that Friday afternoon I had two of my three , uh , employees had to call out sick due to a stomach bug and that they just weren't , uh , capable of working . So that left me and one other person at the sale and then not having anybody left now to run the , the office that we have . So we were immediately understaffed and you know , it was kind of in a quick panic about how are we going to have to sell , cause this was an important sale , but we didn't want to have people show up waiting in long lines and so forth . I didn't want the sale to seeing in efficient and unprofessional . So , you know , I had to adapt pretty quickly . Uh , so thankfully , you know , I honestly , I , I call up my mom and got her to come help with the , uh , at the , at the sales register , cash register at the event , uh , you know , jotting down sales and so forth , uh , to kind of taught her really quickly . I knew she was good with numbers , she'd worked in that kind of role before , so thankfully had a personal resource I could lean on there , but then also reached out to a former employee and asked if he would be free and offered to , uh , pay him his previous rate plus a bonus if he could help out on short notice . And he was someone who I would trust completely given his previous experience and he was able to , uh , he was able to come and help out . Um , his as well . And then I did make the decision for , for our office that I did have the clothes that , you know , I couldn't find someone to help . And I've posted messages on social media and so forth about , you know , staffing issues and having an in person event . And , you know , we just couldn't , we just couldn't be open that day . So , you know , the , the situation wasn't as ideal as I wanted to , but I was relatively satisfied that we were still able to , to have a successful sale that I felt like , uh , when off without , without a hitch . Uh , for the most part , uh , we didn't run into any big challenges . We didn't face any issues with , with any , any , any experience or anything like that . And a lot of our regular customers at our sales and our store , you know , that they were definitely understanding . They understood , you know , sickness happens , people have to miss work , uh , unexpectedly . So despite like an initial kind of panic attack about how well is this going to go , was ultimately relatively pleased with how the weekend went and , you know , profit that we made .","Okay . So one time that I experienced difficulty keeping a commitment at work due to other priorities was , uh , so one aspect of our business is we do consignments . So we sell items on behalf for , for , for our customers or clients for I , for a percentage for a fee . And we'd had a client scheduled , uh , for a consignment . We were going to list it within about the next week , uh , but kind of at the last minute , a couple of days before that was supposed to start , we had another client approached us and said that they wanted a consignment for us , but they wanted to go ahead and get it listed immediately . Uh , they needed the money and could we prioritize that ? And you know , after doing research on the value , it was like the , about the items , excuse me , that they wanted us to sale . It was going to be a very lucrative sale . Didn't feel like I could afford to pass up that business , but it meant we weren't going to have the staffing to get that other consignment completed all the time or all scheduled . And we said we would . Uh , so what I did was I approached the original consignment client and explain the situation that there might be at delay . And I asked where they would they be okay with that and to sort of make them still feel valued and so forth . I offered them a 10% discount on our , on our typical consignment fee and promise to get the items listed up , uh , you know , a week after the original date . Um , and they were very understanding that was not a a time sensitive , uh , deal that they needed to get done . Uh , so then I approached a new client and said , you know , we would be able to handle you on a handle . You own such short notice and uh , was able to get both items , are both client lots or consignments listed and made a great profit on both of them . And the amount of money that I made from the , the second consignment client more than made up for the 10% discount , uh , that I gave to gate to the original client . So the ability to adapt in that situation and understanding changes in priorities happen . And I think as long as you're honest and communicate that clearly and still make that other client feel , feel valued , uh , you know , that's something you have to do sometimes as a business owner is to , to make certain priorities clear and adjust your priorities as necessary . So I was very satisfied , uh , with , with that situation , both clients were ultimately happy with the job that we performed for them , that the money that we made and so forth as well .",4.333333333,3.333333333,3,3,3.75
28,Pbm7vbj-d8rgbk,"The situation was we were working towards a very hard deadline . Um , that was approximately one month in the future . It was a public filing , uh , for an annual report for a publicly traded company . And one of the key people on the team that's responsible for a sizable chunk of work , uh , decided to leave the company . Um , and it was very unexpected and the timing was , was not favorable at all . And , uh , this person was a key member of the team that we actually identified for promotion and we thought they were , you know , for lack of a better term , a lifer . Um , they were not . So , uh , we were kind of left , uh , scratching our heads with a ton of work to do and everyone on the team during this time of year , we're not staffed where people have extra time during , during these really heavy annual reporting period . So we immediately were very understaffed and it's a very technical position that takes a lot of practice and expertise and knowhow . So without this particular person , we , the situation that was already complex became even more complex . And , um , managing that team . I , uh , I had a few different , I had to employ a few different tactics to get the work done . Um , one of those tactics was of course doing , doing some of it myself and I could have done all of it myself , um , and probably killed myself in the process , but I , instead of doing that , which probably was the easiest solution , I , I kinda took some time to think about a way to make it positive and cause when there , when that person left , it created a lot of opportunity and I was kinda curious who else saw that as an opportunity ? Uh , aside from myself . So , um , I talked to some of the aspiring younger people on the team and asked if they'd be interested in trying something new . And surprisingly , uh , basically everyone said yes . Uh , so I kind of learned something , um , about the team . And there was about four individuals that said yes , out of , out of six . And then I just broke the project down into , you know , a different , different form than it was and reassigned , uh , the roles and responsibilities of that person to inexperienced people relative to the work that was being done and just committed to , rather than doing it all myself to spend my time , uh , coaching those people and I'm trying to get them , they were already excited to do it . So actually I kind of learned a lot about , about just having people that are excited to do something , um , how well they can actually do . So I think that would really , that experience taught me a lot about managing a project and how there's a lot of creative ways to put the right people on the right task .","We , uh , we acquired , um , throughout the year . We're always acquiring . Uh , we're a very large company and , uh , we're always acquiring smaller companies with , uh , various , um , in the finance , various knowhow in the finance , um , in their finance department . Uh , various expertise , various know-how , various systems , various philosophies on how to approach numbers and reporting . And , um , with a particular acquisition , it was actually a larger one for us . And in this particular , usually the larger the acquisition , the more easier it is in some ways because they , the company's finance department is more fleshed out and they , they know what they're doing . But in this particular one , it was very different , uh , the way they did things . And with , with these types of acquisitions , we always make a commitment that , you know , it's , it's always a for top management , uh , that the business guys trying to , you know , they care about the strategy of it . And in finance , it just has to get done . So with every acquisition , the first commitment is yeah , in like six months , they're going to be part of the company and we won't even know that they were , that they were new at all . Only six months ago . All the processes will be integrated . They'll , they'll know all of our lingo . We'll be able to readily communicate between the executive team at the acquiree and , and um , the core , the core team . Well what this particular that that was not going to be the case . And even when I made the commitment , I was like , ah , this , this one has some risk to it for sure . Um , but I typically don't like to talk about the risks forever . I just , we would just figure it out as we go . So to do that , um , it really involved communication . Um , cause that's usually the answer for most complicated projects is to communicate and to learn and map out along the way who , who does what , who wants to do what , who , who can do what and who's willing to change , who wants to change , who can change ? Cause those are the things that just need to happen . So if upon communicating to the team and over , over at the company we acquired , I was kinda able to map out kind of the , the , the players that were there and kind of what the , how the puzzle went together in order to successfully integrate them . And really it came down to just finding the people with , uh , with the right attitude that wanted to do it and figure out a way to get them to the new normal , which , which of course has some favorable things and some unfavorable things like more , you know , more rigid processes , more more sign-offs and things like that . But in the end , I think , I think taking , uh , taking the step to , to plan ahead of time based on the people that were going to be part of the project really made the rest of the steps fall into place .","Okay . Um , this one was , uh , early on in my career when I , when I was an auditor , um , I was doing an inventory count at a , at a manufacturing facility and you know , these facilities are , they're just giant facilities with pallets and pallets of , of different , uh , inventory and you know , and depending on the company , it's a widgets and screws and anything else . And you know , our job is to walk in and select something , randomly encounter it . And when I was very early on in my career , of course I would , I was trying to like get them of course , like , so I'd pick like hard things and I picked this one pallet to count and then you're going around with like the plant controller and they pull the pelt out and you just count whatever's on it and then you look in their inventory records and match it up and move along . And I was kind of picking stuff that was kind of off the beaten path . There's more and more numerous oddly shaped things . And I pick this palette and immediately I could tell something was wrong . They're like , Oh , are you sure you really want that palette ? And I'm like , yeah , so they get a forklift , bring it down . I counted . And then I checked it to the , to the inventory records and they said , Oh no , come over here real quick . Like we'll , we'll let , let's see that report . I was like , okay , I'll follow him cause I don't , I'm young , I didn't really know what I was doing . I come back and like we recounted it and there was like another one there so , so that it matched what I was expecting and I was just like , Oh , like I think one got added but I can't , I can't be certain . And of course it was a , it was a real dilemma for me and it honestly , it still would be . And I , I think I did the right thing even then . But I just like talk , I looked at the control . I'm like , is , I mean I can't , Yeah . W w what we counted here , it's a , Hey , if , if you had to add one , um , I would like to know about it . But if not , at least , you know , if your official statement is that there's 22 of these here , um , that's what I'm going to record . But , uh , but yeah , so that , that's fine . Then I , I moved down in , in past them , but I always kind of wondered what happened there . And I hope that if there , if there was an issue or a breakdown that , uh , that they resolved it , uh , after that . So it was a , it was definitely , um , was torn on what to do .","The company was in the midst of a spinoff transaction , which is , uh , takes a lot of hands on deck and a lot of each hand has to work , you know , the work of five hands each . So it's , it's very , it's a very prolonged period of , of stress and , and just like uncertainty . So over about eight months I kind of was able to develop personal strategies and tactics and change , change my approach to work in order to deal with that , that stress . And I think what I ultimately , my biggest takeaway is that I still remember now , this was a few years ago , was uh , going outside and taking a walk was , was highly valuable . And I think the , what really made maybe walking is great , but uh , maybe more , more specifically , what about the walk really helped , I think is just taking yourself out of the situation because stress is an emotion and you know , it starts to , it starts to cloud your , your rational side , which you really need to deal with these , these types of situations , especially in a professional setting . So getting outside and I would actually take routine walks even even when I wasn't particularly stressed , even in a lull in the stress , just to kind of continually recenter myself so that I'd be ready to deal with . I was always ready to deal with something unforeseen because the unforeseen , if it was something that was expected , uh , during that time . So I knew if I was just keeping up with my , my walks and you know , even if it's taking a break , stepping away from the computer and a pretty set basis as often as I could , every hour and a half , even though it seemed very counterproductive , I found that I was really ready when , when that curve ball came to , to deal with it and , and to keep my sanity . Um , of course , because it's such a longterm project that it's never about dealing with , with one piece of stress . Well , you have to be , have a strategy to deal with continual stress . Well , and I think , I think that was my big takeaway and it's , it's carried me through my career and in other aspects of life . When I , when I feel those emotions and stressors mounting , it's , it's good to , to step away for a bit before , before reacting .","Yeah , this , this , uh , this was actually one of the bigger projects I've , I've worked on recently and that was , um , avail re redoing our entire reporting to change the segments of the business . And that is a very longterm and complicated project and making a commitment at the beginning is , is , is almost like guessing or it is guessing . So almost by definition in a project management sense , like these types of projects and in most complicated projects , commitments are kind of , they're , they're , they're your best guests and you have to balance staying committed to that and being able to adapt it in all while keeping a , a stable and uh , in , in leadership like quality where everyone on the team does feel like we're moving in the right direction even when that direction is changing . So when we were doing these segments , I felt like inside I was like embarrassed sometimes , but it's just the nature of the beast . Um , I felt like I was changing the deadline so much because our , our initial projections on the timeline for , for reporting with new segments where we're pretty set and we actually made the deadline three months earlier than kind of externally . We were preparing the investors to receive this information . So we knew we had some wiggle room , but that three months of wiggle room started to get eaten up really quickly at very early stages of the project . So I was , I was really nervous because at first I was saying , I knew I had some three months of wiggle room . So I was using that to kind of manage expectations . Like , Hey , there's some cushion built into this . Like , it's going to be okay . And I was able to be the good guy . Um , and everyone was happy . And then later when things were changing , it was like , well , this , we , we have to still do it at the same speed . Um , so that was just a totally different , different type of messaging and that involved kind of knowing what resources we had available across the company , uh , creatively to , to assist people in their efforts to do their piece and really communicate genuinely that the desire and willingness to help out were , as a project manager , I was definitely the project manager lead in that . And it was realizing that like , Hey , I can jump in here if I can actually help , which oftentimes I couldn't , but who do you need ? What do you need ? Like we , we're here to help . Whatever you need , we're going to do our best to get it . And I think , you know , those two different types of messaging , that kind of messaging at the earlier stage when we had time and at the later stage when we didn't have time , both , both were very effective . And there's a time and place for each .",4.666666667,3.5,2,4,4
29,Prmjd38-axeceh,"When I was a receptionist at a barbershop , our manager got fired , unfortunately due to an HR situation and we were in the process of figuring out who was going to be the new manager , which of course creates an uncomfortable environment because we're lacking a leader . And there were some people in the shop that felt that they were entitled to the promotion and were very vocal about it , which created a taking sides type of environment . And I tried my best to stay out of this and not pick sides remain neutral because I knew that it wasn't going to help the situation to give my 2 cents . I hadn't been there that long and whoever was promoted , regardless of whether I wanted them to be or not , was going to be my new manager . And so I needed to start off on the best foot as possible and remain professional in that situation . So I definitely tried to stay out of it and be as neutral as I could when speaking to coworkers about the situation when they decided who was going to be promoted . It was a receptionist from another shop who was in a lead receptionist role . So she was going to transition to our shop , which she was unfamiliar with and that caused some feathers to ruffle up as well because things like , she doesn't even know her shop would be thrown around , things like that . And I ignored the drama side of it and tried to focus on making sure that the manager got acclimated as quickly as possible , um , to make sure that our working environment was smoothing in , no one likes working in an uncomfortable environment . So I took what I thought was the most pragmatic approach of ignoring what people were saying about the decision and instead working with the manager to make sure that she became effective as quickly as possible , uh , to sort of dispel any rumors about her competence as quickly as possible . And also just to create a good work environment . This ended up working out in my favor . I didn't do it to do that , but it did end up working out for me because I was promoted to the position that my manager had just left . So I ended up going to her shop , which was good because some of the drama was not resolved by the time that I left . And I unfortunately had nothing that I could do about that . Um , and so I had done all I could at that shop to help her adjust , and she was adjusting . It was just , people had to get used to it . Um , but I was able to be rewarded for that situation and how I handled it . And , uh , that definitely made me feel like I made the right decision .","When I was a student of the full time software web development boot camp that I now teach at , uh , one of our major assignments was a front end capstone where we were supposed to demonstrate all of the things that we had learned during the first three months of the program . And it was completely individual . We could do whatever we wanted as long as we met certain guidelines . And I took it upon myself to try to be very , uh , impressive with this project . And I wanted to implement a third party API , which was by no means required , but I knew that it would look impressive . And we were demoing our projects to our classmates and I wanted it to look really nice and demonstrate everything that I could do . I underestimated how difficult implementing this API would be . Uh , and it was very clear that I wasn't going to be able to just figure it out on the spot as I imagined that I would . So very quickly , I involved my project mentor , uh , manager , if you will , one of the instructors of my cohort . And he sat some time aside with me and went over how to implement this thing and help me sort of debug some of the situation . Um , after I had thoroughly read the documentation of course to figure out what I could , and it turned out that I was fairly close and , uh , implementing the API , but there were a couple of things that I was missing that having some previous experience definitely would have helped me , uh , realize . But because I had taken it upon myself to do something completely new for my capstone that I had no experience with , I did not know these things . And so by reaching out quickly to my instructor who of course didn't know these things , I was able to save time and ended up still implementing it properly . My capstone turned out very well and I definitely learned not to take on brand new challenges when I have no idea what they're going to entail , uh , in any sort of given project . Doing as much research as I can before making the decision to take on that challenge is crucial and making sure that I'll have the resources available . It should , I need them , uh , in order to receive help with this challenge . So definitely realizing scope of , um , the things that I'm attempting in a short amount of time was one of the results . And the other result was , unfortunately , because I took the proper actions to resolve my issue , I was able to create a successful capstone that did in fact impress my classmates .","When I was in my first year and only year of law school , I quickly realized that being a lawyer was not the career path that I wanted to take . Uh , and that even though I was enjoying law school itself , that I would not enjoy the career that followed . It became evident to me very quickly that I needed to leave law school and figure out my next steps . But as I had just moved to DC from my original state of Tennessee , I was far away from home , did not know very many people , um , only knew people at my law school and was conflicted about what to do because I knew this was a big decision , but that the longer I waited , the more money I would potentially be wasting by staying there . Uh , and the more time I would be wasting as well not figuring out what I actually wanted to do . So I consulted with the Dean of students with my academic advisor , um , with a couple of students in higher levels of law school that I looked up to as mentors . My family . Of course , I took any and all opinions of what they felt that I should do to sort of see both sides of things because of course people at my law school encouraged me to maybe take some time , take a gap year , figure things out , a sabbatical of sorts to figure out if I actually wanted to do this instead of making such a final decision while my family just wanted me to be happy and definitely were conflicted because they wanted me to come home , but they understood that I needed to do what I needed to do . Ultimately , I did some research . I thought about what my future career would look like . I considered the financial aspect of things . If I liked where I was living , I really gathered all of the information that I could and let that inform my decision as much as it could , but I did also realize that my heart wasn't in it and that despite all of the information and the pragmatic approach that I took , I ultimately realized that I just wasn't meant for that career path . It wasn't something that was going to fulfill me , and that was the most important information of all . So I did end up first taking some time away and then ultimately dropping out of law school , which now I'm a successful software developer , so I'm glad that I made that decision , but I wouldn't have if I hadn't realized that sometimes your emotional and is the most important information that you can gather .","In my current role as a junior instructor at the full time web development bootcamp that I was originally a student of . I am now in charge of students , uh , progression through the program and during our capstone time , I take on several of those students as mentees to guide them through their capstone , be there as their advisor , their sort of point person or any troubles that they may have , any ideas that they have . And really I'm sort of the main person deciding whether or not they should continue in the program . Now , usually this is very fulfilling and fairly straight forward , but I had a mentee who was struggling in the program and it soon came out that he was neurodivergent . He has autism and ADHD , so it made it very difficult for him to succeed academically in our program . But I did very much believe in him and he very much wanted to continue in the program . So I worked with him extra , uh , to make sure that he understood the concepts and sort of gathered a game plan to get him through this capstone season . I broke things down into smaller steps for him to make sure that there were more points for him to check in than I would with other , uh , mentees of mine that didn't need quite as much guidance . He needed someone to kind of help him keep on track . So I did provide that for him . But that additional labor when I had other mentees was indeed very stressful and he also was still struggling and I had to walk him through a lot of things that typically we don't have to walk people through at that point . So it became should he pass ? And I didn't want that on my shoulders . That was a lot , and it's technically not supposed to be on my shoulders in terms of my job description , but I very much felt for him that we don't really have any accommodations for the neurodivergent students that we have and that there are additional challenges and blockers for them . So one of the outcomes that came from this is that after it was over , he did indeed pass and did better in the second half of the program . As my hunch suggested that he would . So I learned , of course , that my instinct sometimes is correct and that I should listen to that when making decisions . But also I took it to upper management that we needed to have a discussion about how to best handle neurodivergence in our program because there are a lot of neurodivergent people out there who want to enter the tech industry . Um , and we needed to figure out ways to better accommodate them .","In my current position as a junior instructor at my full time web development bootcamp , one of my duties is to be on the interviewing team or prospective students . Now this isn't something that's required of my position . It's something that I've volunteered for . Even though it was somewhat suggested that I should join this team . It was not required , but it is definitely a commitment once you've joined . And I knew that they were short handed , so I volunteered myself . And this is normally not an issue . I like talking to people . I love being part of determining whether potential students could succeed in this career path and this school and making sure that everyone gets placed in a situation that's going to be beneficial to them . But , uh , during busier times in the actual boot camp itself , my job becomes very demanding and I have fewer times that I'm available for interviews . I feel bad about this because a lot of times the people that are over the interviewing team will reach out to me and ask if I can sign up for any of the interview slots . And usually the answer is no . So I try to be as upfront with them as possible . Let them know I'm so sorry I'm in the middle of capstones . I have little to no time to interview this week . And I also try to make up for it by volunteering my time when I do have slots available in my day , even if it's slightly inconvenient , I will still take those interview spots during those less busy weeks because I know it's sort of an all hands on deck situation and everyone's work is important . Everyone has things that they're sacrificing in order to be part of this interviewing team . So I try my best to do my part . Uh , the outcome of this is that I am still on the interviewing team and um , I have a good relationship with my coworkers who were over the interviewing team because they know that I'm one being honest with them when I say that I can't and not just because I don't feel like it . And two , I do my best to make their job easier because I know that they are also taking on this additional responsibility in addition to their normal job responsibilities . So I try to accommodate as much as I can by helping out and making myself available .",3.333333333,3.75,3.666666667,4,3.333333333
30,Pd32vjk-fz65sd,"to abide by the ever changing building code of New York city . They basically had a project that was , I would say , on the lines of being declined if we didn't move quickly too ascertain what the building code was that they would have filed under , and also made provisions two kind of changed the scheduling of the project based on what code we were . Oh , and the meat at that time . So what it meant was putting in enough provisions and enough contingencies to allow for options for us to pick up as the project went alone , to not slow down the project at all , but at the same time give them that's possible results to the client . So in a construct and constructive way , we always looked at the project and said , nothing is finalized until everything is . But we also allowed us significant time and different options with our vendors and suppliers to allow the client to choose the most optimal path for them forward . That allows us to be able to adapt best and fulfill the outcome the client wants the most .","Two , two budget constraints and also the timeline constraints . The client basically offered , uh , increased bonus incentive if we were able to , Hey , get all the drawings completed , bye . Set that line be to deliver material ed of what we promise in the contract , a contract language and not that it wasn't possible even just talking to them . But in order to reach these goals , we had to basically , uh , divvy up the tasks without our usual coordination , which is to work on one drawing and then to pass it on amongst the team and the finally getting all together for one final review before we submit to the client . Okay . Here we sort of took a risk where each individual team member works tackling tasks is individually okay . Uh , first coordination , but basically what okay did to kind of really shrink the time is two , facilitate the coordination aspect . Bye . Working okay currently with one another , but at the same time reporting to a one set team leader that was able to kind of divvy up the coordination responsibilities . And the end result was that we were able to deliver the project on time and serving as that team leader . That time , it allowed me to look at each individual tasks and see how I could streamline and perform the most efficiently to deliver the drawings and then hustles products to the client , not just on time , but ahead of schedule .","Basically tasked with an onsite condition that was both described to me . Okay . Both by my own team and then subsequently by the general contractor on site that I was tasked to make a decision of basically conflicting information on what it was done at the installation site and because a lot of the work was finished around hours subsequently covered over it , you really cannot trust where one set versus another set . My team is always going to say we did something to the best of our ability and definitely to the fulfillment of the contract language . However , the GC is always going to harp on us not providing evidence of that case and with multiple information coming in for multiple people . The actions that I took this basically dissect , I saw during the installation process to piece together the photos that I saw final decision that what we installed is reflection of what we submitted in the photos as evidence in the se . Yeah . Yeah . This particular site that we did something different , deviate from . Oh , the other ones that we did is unreasonable and I challenged them , the , the general contractor to open up any of these conditions and to find out if , right . basically it's my conference in the , the , the work that we did that I would say that if I'm wrong , we would pay for the bridge . Wow . I was right . They would basically paid us to reinstall it . So I think that our actions reflect the confidence we have in our own work .","Because of it error in our drafting department , essentially an error on our part . We did manufacturing products that yeah . Not in alignment with the other finishes , the components in the job site . So let us to basically have a meeting . But first internally or knowing what it was that when brawl and subsequently how do we respond and then how do we learn from this . The response here is basically tell the client that we could adjust the way our finishes are . Two kind of make it more in alignment . Okay . What everything around us is okay . telling them that even though it won't match perfectly , it would also just the not really noticeable from uh , room to room . So the approach there here is you have to take a sense that since it was our fault as a company to take yeah . Ownership of the problem , taking accountability and offer a solution . And I think when that's the outcome , it's easier to accept instead of okay , flat out admitting guilt Oh , admitted fault , but not really having any sort of a solution . So I think we have to learn how to not repeat this mistake , but also in the sense that when we do have the stakes , we have to own them . Okay . Ultimately find solution .","Basically because we promise the client drawings and then product delivery at a certain date on this important project for a client that we've worked on , uh , extensively , I have extensive experience working with before that we made it a priority to keep them in mind . The situation here was that basically I agree promise three employees their time off and that would affect it . The timeline of the project and the actions that we took . Yeah , basically . Okay . Two again , the via the work . Okay . Give the client maybe a preliminary set and say that more information is to follow . It lets the clients think that instead of receiving a full set that we are making every effort to kind of meet deadlines it gives us a chance to catch up work when we are submitting it piecemeal rather than the whole thing . Obviously we prefer to get the whole thing done completely on time , but in that specific scenario we were able to kind of tell the client that meanwhile we're given this bits and pieces of information to you , you could review and get back to us . So incidentally , we might have been late on the drawings , bye . Two weeks . But since we gave the drawings , we started giving them time to review three weeks in advanced . They were , we were able to come up to the same , uh , delivery of product you . So in the end , do not lose any time .",3,3,3.333333333,2.666666667,2.666666667

So when I came to this location , I really had to take the time to get to know other people that I was working with , listen to them , uh , understand where they're coming from and , you know , meet and greets just to go over , you know , my expectations here , what their expectations are . And then from there , really get a good sense of what to expect , uh , from both me and my team .","Most recently I had a project where I had to come up with a parking plan for six concerts and two , uh , what we call dirt shows or muster jam . And this was a very difficult project to achieve because ultimately the project itself required me to formulate a plan based on a previous year events , which I have not worked before . So what I had to do to be able to achieve this goal was to research previous events through our shared drive and Excel spreadsheets . We had to pick out data that was important , that I felt that was important for this project to create this a parking plan . Uh , and what I did was I picked out certain parts I felt were important and what I did next to really be able to fully achieve the result of this project was reach out to a friend , uh , at work or coworkers you say , where I was able to thankfully , uh , you know , the term of what , what was needed , what was not needed , and then formulate a plan that achieved the results .","Recently had a situation where , um , my supervisor was out of town , so I was only able to reach him or , uh , my , uh , area manager either , which they were both out of town .

Uh , and I was asked by at least three or four different coworkers , Hey , can use this as person outside . They want to do an event . So I was getting different information as far as what this gentleman wants to do . So ultimately what I did was I went outside , talked to the gentleman for about five to 10 minutes , uh , gain the details of what he was looking to do as far as the event .

Ultimately , the final decision was , unfortunately , the vent didn't work because we had other events taking place , so we were not able to do that .","A recent time where to deal with a really stressful situation was working a parking event for a concert in which I was short staffed by about 10 people on my team . So short-staffed . And then furthermore , I didn't have , uh , the capacity to be able to , uh , perform , uh , at the highest level for our event because I was missing our , a majority of my team . So the way that I handled this situation was I got my leads together and also my , uh , supervisor and captain , and we reviewed basically what we could do with this event as far as what was possible , what was not possible when trying to go through this . And ultimately I determined that the best way to handle this type of event was to , uh , work with what I did have , and also reach out to other members of the organization to say that extra staffing to help me be able to , to perform successfully in the grass and the grass of the event .","Well , most recently I had three or four different projects going on at the same time . And this was very difficult to try to muster the ability to do all these tasks . Um , I had a parking plan I was working on and I was also trying to interview someone and also meet with a prospective client as well . Uh , and this made it very difficult . So what I had to do ultimately was I was meeting with the client . I explained to the client , you know , you're , you're a value client . I really want to help you further . However , at this time I do have a few other obligations . Let me circle back with you when I can . The other obligations , of course , uh , you know , the parking plan and trying to do a job interview was someone coming up . So all that being said , uh , I was able to , you know , work around my , uh , my client and also the parking plan and the job interview to fully be able to complete and fulfill my obligations with each one .",2.333333333,2.5,3,2.666666667,2.666666667
32,Ptcyhad-abha6k,"So for a little while , I had to work from home and it was really strange going from the office to working in my office in my house . Um , we actually turned our guest bedroom into an office for my job and , um , to change or to help with the change , I did many things to make it more comfortable . Uh , for example , I may check out a really nice expensive leather chair so that when I'm sitting there for hours , I will be comfortable . And , uh , I also added a lot of light so I could , you know , have a lot of nice , bright light and , um , not feel tired from beginning to dim in there . And I also added some houseplants , some frames with pictures , um , some decorations just to make it feel less like a cramped office and more like a homely experience . So , um , those are the things I did to make it more comfortable . And , um , now I'm at the actual office , so I'm not working from home anymore . But , uh , it was definitely , I definitely had to do a lot of things to make it more comfortable and to adapt to the changes .","So at my office , we had to hire a new bookkeeper and I kept getting interviews from people that weren't qualified at all . Um , people who would pretend to be qualified . But then when I asked them questions about counting and bookkeeping , they wouldn't know the answers to the questions . So it was very hard to figure out who I should call in for an interview because there's so many just , uh , you know , um , acting like they overachieved when they actually haven't , or claiming to have much more experience than they actually do . And some of the time , not even being in a related field , but saying that they were , so , it was really difficult to find someone . Um , so eventually I , instead of trying to get employees from , you know , just random areas from posting on indeed , instead , I had people at my work , um , talk to their family members and find someone who they know is qualified . So , for example , um , someone at my job would ask their mom if they knew anyone in accounting or bookkeeping , and their mom would say yes and give us their number , and we'd call and give them a competitive salary and ask them if they'd like to come in for an interview . So things like that . And that worked a lot better because then we had people vouching for them . Uh , and then , uh , the result was we did get one , someone , a woman who was qualified for the job , and she's been there for over a year now and she's doing really great . So it turned out in her best interest .","So there's a man at my work , uh , that I supervised and , um , whenever I was around he seemed to be working really hard . Um , but I had a lot of people tell me otherwise that he would just sit around whenever I wasn't around and , um , that you said inappropriate things sometimes . Um , and that , you know , he would , he had very strong political views and he would just go on and on about his political views and conspiracy theories instead of actually doing his job . So , um , what I did was when he was working , I had some people I trusted to check in on him and call me , basically spy on him and call me and tell me what he was doing . Um , because my boss made me make a decision on whether he should be fired or whether he should stay . Um , so yeah , so I had people spy on him basically . And , um , tell me what he was doing and turned out he really wasn't doing a lot of work . And then , um , my last , the very last thing that happened that had we done with him was when he , uh , he , uh , called me and told me that he had only gotten a short , a small amount of things done on an eight hour working day . He basically only got one thing done out of a list of like six things I needed him to get done . And at the most , that one thing would have taken 15 minutes . And he knew I'd find out the next day that he hadn't done it . So he texted or he actually called me and told me and I asked him what he was doing all that time . And you know , he said he was doing that one thing the whole time . And I definitely didn't believe that . And so when I asked someone at work , they told me that he was hardly doing anything . So , um , that was the last straw . And that was when I decided that I did need to fire him and replace him with someone else .","So this happened a long time ago when I first got into a career . Um , so I had a customer that was really upset with me . Um , he thought I , uh , bumped into his car as I was walking into work and , um , I think I did graze it a little bit , but , um , he was really mad . He was screaming at me . He was cussing at me . He was calling me names , and he was making this really big scene . Um , since I was at the beginning of my career . I ended up crying , but I also yelled at him back , which wasn't the professional response to have . But , um , my boss came out and told me that some customers went in and told her that , uh , that this guy started yelling at me for no reason and that I wasn't doing anything and that he was basically picking on me . And so , um , due to that , uh , uh , you know , obviously my boss trusted the customers , but unfortunately , um , I still got a strike against me at that job for my response to it . Um , so , uh , yeah , so the outcome was I learned a big lesson to , uh , you know , not , not scream back , no matter how mad I am at a customer , and , um , just behave in a calm manner and try to deescalate things instead of escalating it .","Um , so we had just gotten a new employee and we had a lot of work that needed to be done . That's why we hired a new person and we actually needed multiple people . But so far we only had one person . And , um , I was in charge of training her and weeks before then I had , um , signed up to go to my son's school field trip and be a chaperone . Um , and I told my boss about that , but my boss said , sorry , but we need you that day . Um , because we have a lot to work to get done and you need to train the woman that we just hired because you are the only person that knows things like QuickBooks and things like that . And it's very important that you're here on Sunday . And normally I don't come into work on Sundays , so I wasn't expecting the possibility to have to go into work . And , uh , you know , my son was really looking forward to that field trip and me going on it with him , especially because he has a bit of anxiety being away from me . So I wanted to support him in that . Um , unfortunately I ended up having to make a tough decision and I had to choose my job over my son's field trip . And you know , I just told him he had to go without me . And I told the school that I was sorry , but I couldn't be a chaperoned anymore .",2.666666667,2.75,2.666666667,1.333333333,3
33,P5xkpz2-c3ggrf,"Okay . My , my , uh , it departments with to a new content management system , my or some of the writers were apprehensive about this change . I was eager to learn a new system , especially if is going to make our workflow more efficient . Since I knew the sooner I learned this system , the sooner I could get work . I took it upon myself to ask the it department how to house a training station . They agreed and many of the writers were transformed our , this idea by paying attention to the station and looking forward to the supplementary merit materials . I had a working knowledge of the system within one Workday and 18 this year , Tam , where I had to learn a new task at work and I was able to spit up the learning process .","You know , to get one project complete . In my previous job , I found out who the key stakeholders were and not their input on the project . Uh , different parks . Then I allied a major milestone that would be involved in completing the project and work backwards to print out the work that good need to be done . At this stage , I created a list up on possible rates that my stubborn from reaching those milestones and I then added some extra time to the schedule in case anything unexpected came up . I won , so made sure that my role and responsibilities in the project was clear as possible . So I knew exactly what I had to do . The protest was completed on time , but it came back . I realized there were some problems that could be avoided if I sample , I would have to change a step pro 10 in order to avoid some of the minor scheduling problems we ran into . Having to say that is on way easy to see what the learning are after a project has been completed and I now know what I do differently in the next time .","In my job where I work , I had to make a decision when interacting with an angry customer is wanted to return an item that didn't have a receipt or the closing tasks on the project under product . I tell him that I couldn't accept returns without receipt and he started yelling at me demanding that I give him a refund . I didn't want this customer to get angrier , so I had to think critically about what to do . I decided to first the escalate things by asking the customer about when they had bought the item and how much it has cost . It relaxed a bit and answered my questions and eventually came . Now when I said I would go get my manager so they could discuss the situation , I think diffusion the situation first with the right choice . I was able to prevent a customer from making decisions that would have upset or the principals , my managers was so happy that I asked for their help rather than just giving money to an angry customer to pacify him .","Okay . So last year in my champ , we had a difficult coworker who was creating a bit of trauma around the office . Personally , I felt that it would not be right to let this continue . So I went to management and HR and just spread my concerns about how it was affecting the team . A team communication for me is vital to handle stressful communications . I know that my , I'll respond to stress will have a direct impact on autism around me . So I'm intent . My outcome , I taking time out in my day to clear my head for sample . Uh , I often , uh , I often go to a yoga class so I could feel crowded and calm and , uh , even in certain , uh , moments .","So , uh , my child has multiple conflicting priorities where it can be difficult to know what is the most important and urgent run my boss and I would tell and the important and urgent scale for rating task so that it is clear what takes the highest priority . If sometime it's both important and urgent , it gets , uh , highest priority . Important but not urgent is NEC and urgent but not important . Is next . Then not important and not urgent is that my boss knows the writing system and even cause request as a you and you uni and NA need you when sending them to me . As a result , my , our productivity in the past year has gone up considerably and make against prior to using our priority taxation rating system . .",4,3,3.333333333,2.666666667,2.333333333
34,P3qdf3e-h6bmtu,"Uh , one time I had to adapt to a complex and changing work environment would be about two years ago in 2020 , as we're all aware , in 2020 , the world's was met with the unprecedented COBIT 19 Corona virus pandemic . During that time , a lot of companies experienced rapid and drastic changes . And the company that I worked for was not an exception . I was employed with a company , a , we'll call it F , R N , and it was an amazing role . I was part of an amazing team . However , our company was , um , it wasn't acquired by a company they had already owned us , but they decided to dissolve FRN and transport our teams from FRN into the new parent companies , uh , internal teams . So during that transition , we had to rapidly , uh , modify our work arrangements . We had to learn a whole new system of care . Um , I had to pick up , um , I was responsible for about 10 clients and now I'm responsible for about a hundred . Um , and so it was a very complex , um , change as you can imagine , uh , with , you know , a company change like that . Um , but I think that everything went really well and I managed to successfully be in the role for two years now . So I think that proves that I am perfectly capable of handling it . Well .","My current role , I am responsible for managing our quarterly educational webinars that go out to our referral partners and community partners . Um , so I'm responsible for , uh , the entire project and that's everything from signing the contracts to finding the speakers , to pay the speaker fees , to defining the topics that we're going to educate on , pulling our audience to see what they'd like to see as well as the metrics and performance of these sessions . Uh , so when I started , uh , managing this project , I , uh , decided to do an analysis of how these were performing and then establish goals based on the historical data and , uh , how topics were performing . I did a really comprehensive analysis of how many registrants we were getting , how many attendees we were getting , how many people were completing the post , a webinar assessment . And then , um , I decided to set some lofty goals from there . Um , and from there I was able to use strategic decisions to increase all of those metrics positively and now they are about twice as effective as when I took them over .","The most recent example that I can think of . I'm in a situation where I had to make a decision quickly , but was faced with conflicting information from multiple sources , was done in my most recent role a couple of months ago . Uh , so I had a client reach out to me and ask me if they could do , um , a specific item , uh , or initiate a specific project . And I wasn't entirely sure if that fell within our , um , my roles division . So what I did is I reached out to my coworkers and my direct supervisor , um , because my coworkers are quite knowledgeable and so I figured , you know , whomever is available , answer this question for me . Um , my direct supervisor and my coworkers gave me two different answers . So what I did was , um , I reached out to my direct supervisor and said , Hey , coworker said X , Y , and Z . You said ABC . Um , my understanding is H , J . K , how about we do something that can mind all of this ? I think this covers everything . Um , so my direct supervisor is new to the role and my coworkers and I have been in these roles for two , three years . Um , so in that , uh , opportunity , I was cognizant that , uh , she may not have the most up to date understanding and most complete understanding because she is so new to the role . Um , but I did use her feedback because I liked that direction that she wanted to take our , um , I liked the direction she wanted to take our department and our , uh , processes . So instead of just doing what the coworker suggested , I was able to take all of that and we came up with , um , a solution that was a combination of all of our understanding and something that would be beneficial for the team moving forward .","My pressure is very much the nature of my current job . Uh , so as I mentioned at another question , I do currently manage about 101 clients . Um , at this time for my company , I do work for a fortune 300 company . So all of these clients are subsidiaries of , uh , the main company . Um , and so with that I manage a really high volume of requests , questions , inquiries , all that good stuff , um , as well as lots of turnaround times , uh , project time , um , due dates that are coming up soon . Uh , just lots of things and lots of pressure because every single client wants to perform to their maximum potential and every single client wants to , um , you know , receive all of their collateral in a timely fashion . Uh , so in this role , last spring of 2021 , my direct supervisor was leaving on maternity leave in the month , month of March . Um , and so during that time , my coworkers and I were operating without a direct supervisor and right before she was supposed to return , she did end up resigning from the company to stay home with the new baby . And , um , it took our company about six or seven months to fill that role . So for almost an entire year , my team and I had to manage our clients as well as our direct supervisors responsibilities , uh , all without someone to report to you and help us . Uh , so this was extremely stressful because a lot of the priorities that we picked up were high level leadership , um , responsibilities and projects . And as I mentioned , uh , it is a fortune 300 companies . So when I say leadership , I mean like the chief marketing officer , the chief financial financial officer , the CEO , all for a company that has , you know , several thousand , 10,000 . I am not sure exactly how large , I think it's at a hundred thousand or 10,000 employees . Um , a really , really significant size , you know , with over 300 , um , the facilities in the United States and Europe . Um , so working on these high level projects was really incredibly stressful and very , very pressure , um , oriented just due to the nature of the responsibility that we took on and had to manage for nearly a year . The outcome was quite wonderful . Um , my team at night received , uh , an absorbent amount of praise from , uh , the people that we work with during this time . Uh , we also were all given promotions and , uh , substantial salary increases due to how we handled ourselves during this time because we did so well . Um , we were just really good . So I would say the outcome was great , and I'm more than capable of doing that moving forward .","Yeah . So , um , you know , I'm sounding like a broken record here , but again , uh , in my current role , I do have , um , over a hundred clients and I do work for a fortune 300 company . Um , and for almost an entire year I was operating without a direct supervisor and interacting with leadership , um , and all of that good stuff . Um , so one specific situation I can think of is the company had a priority , uh , marketing campaign that needed to be launched and it was a very quick turnaround time due to , um , a really competitive ad offer that we received from a vendor . Um , so during this time I was having to manage this project as well as my a hundred clients . And , um , with all of that , there was a lot going on , a lot of things , um , you know , that could potentially fall through the cracks . Um , so what I did to manage that is I have a really robust , uh , system in my inbox to keep up with my , uh , emails that need to be followed up with replied to , um , anything that needs to be submitted into our system . I started blocking off time on my calendar so I could get stuff done . Um , instead of leaving my calendar open and having people schedule meetings where I would have awkward amounts of times , uh , you know , 15 , 30 , 45 minutes in between meetings , it's not a productive amount of time for me . So I would block off times an hour , two hours here and there , uh , depending on my workload and I , um , would assign that as productive , unproductive time . Um , so I did that . I also relied heavily on my team to help fill in any blanks and connect any dots that I couldn't fill in or do myself . I also asked for help from , um , the person that I was reporting to during this time who was on our leadership board . Um , but of course it didn't want to do that too often because I didn't want to bother her , uh , due to her position . Um , but the outcome was great . Not no deadlines for miss . Everything that competed . Um , all the emails got replied to the project , um , got kicked off and most of the success .",3.333333333,3,3,3.333333333,3.666666667
35,P557ugi-f5akhz,"Yeah . For me , uh , I work in sports media , which , uh , is a market and an industry where you pretty much have to roll with the punches and learn on the fly and brace yourself for rapidly changing situations all the time . Uh , so I think probably the one that sticks out to me is , uh , just a few years back , we're primarily a content based written , uh , uh , content in terms of what we publish out there related to sports media . But a few years ago , a lot of influence from , I think it was Facebook and Mehta and , uh , whatever the company is called these days , uh , a lot of what their messaging was , was pivoting to video . That if you pivot to video and put it on Facebook , on our channels , on social media , it will increase kind of your company's footprint and how it reaches his audience . So our kind of higher ups pivoted our entire business strategy to video two . So instead of it just being , uh , content reports or , uh , columns or even like interactive slide shows is just like a written word thing . A lot of our content switched over to video . Um , so for us it's training all of our , uh , all of our writers how to do just basic stand in videos , how to edit a basic video that , you know , you can have it be kind of your own one man production where you can make a video yourself , have a good to go in 45 minutes . So all of that was definitely a challenge in terms of getting everyone to pull on the same rope . Um , and eventually we kind of hit a happy medium in the years ahead between kind of our bread and butter in terms of , uh , written content and incorporating video content as well . So we've , we found that kind of happy medium , but at the status was challenges to get everyone kind of on the same boat in terms of embracing that kind of shift in thinking .","Yeah . So I'm primarily a sports writer . So for me it's all about finding new angles , new stories that go beyond , you know , I primarily , I primarily cover hockey . So stories that go beyond just when you saw out on the ice or your takeaways from a game or a season or what have you , stuff that , you know , everyone kind of write about everyone who watches hockey or any sport and kind of glean from watching and if you've been a passionate fan . So for me , a lot of what I focus on is , uh , the player themselves and what drives them , what motivates them , what kind of set them on that path to where they were , uh , to get to this stage of their career . So a lot of my writing involves stuff outside of hockey . For them it's usually about their connections with their family , uh , where they're from , hobbies , something that kind of grounds them outside of , uh , just the game itself . So , probably one of the tougher products I had to take on was for a , I actually went up to Alaska , uh , because one of the goal is , uh , the team I cover is from there . And went up there for two weeks , interviewed about 50 different people , uh , that have all told various stories about this goalie and him growing up and it's phishing exploits . And the time he went hiking up in the mountains behind Anchorage almost got lost . Um , a lot of work , but a lot of great stories . I got out of it . Um , ended up being this very large , uh , feature with multiple interviews , uh , video production . So I was able to take some video when I was up there and talked to some people , a very long and arduous process to kind of put it all together . But when the final product was out there , uh , I was over the moon with the results and the goalie I covered , uh , was thrilled about it as well . It was just one where you know , you see the kind of the fruits of your labor when you get to the end of the end of the line there and it was very , very rewarding .","It's actually a perfect timing for a question like this because for me as a sports writer , we're right around the trade deadline for the sport I cover . And this is pretty much what the week leading up to the trade deadline is in terms of you're getting multiple sources reaching out to you . You don't know whether or not sometimes it's , you don't know whether or not what they're saying is accurate . It could be an agent who's trying to get , you know , word out there that raises their client's , uh , ability to get traded or a contract negotiation or stuff like that . So , um , and again , it's one of those ones where you have to read what you're getting . Uh , whether you're , you know , you're getting a text to you , someone's calling you process it right away . And then for whether you sit on it , whether you double check with another source , which is what I usually do . Um , because there's that inherent fear that if you sit on it or you're wondering what's going to happen in a two , three minutes , someone else is going to get that same scoop and they're just gonna run with it . You know , there's other people who are much more reckless in terms of , you know , not fact checking or covering their other sources to see whether or not this information is accurate . So you weigh that , uh , kind of internal strife I guess when you first get some of these scoops . And it's always tough cause you get something , especially something that's very juicy that you want to be the first one , you know , beat people to the punch for it for . But , um , for me it's all about being slow and steady and double checking out sources . I've never been , I've never run with a story that's ended up being , uh , incorrect or wrong or misleading , which is what I pride myself in . There's plenty of people who've made me have beaten me . Uh , and , you know , sometimes the right , and that's when you , you tip your cap , right ? But then there's other times where , uh , you know , they're wrong and their credibility is more or less shredded as a result . So it's something that happens every year . I'm sure I'll probably get a couple of texts later today about , uh , some scoops that I have to do some homework on . Um , but it's part of the job . Makes it interesting to say the least .","Yeah , there was a , there's plenty of things you deal with . Uh , I think I had this question before and it involved , uh , I discussed my time , uh , just meeting deadlines and stuff of this with the job that I have , but I got this one . Um , you know , working with athletes , I pride myself at least on , uh , being very open with guys , um , you know , giving them their space and , you know , wanting to hash things out or if anything goes arise . So I've never had any major conflicts with players . Sometimes it's , you know , an athlete loses a game , they're not in a good mood and even a question that is posed is pretty harmless and kind of snap back at you for . So I asked one player , um , just kinda what he saw in a sequence that led to a goal against , and he was not happy with it . I don't know if he thought maybe I was , you're trying to be snarky with , uh , you know , you know , twisting the knife maybe after a loss . But he , he snapped at me , uh , quite a bit there . And at that point you don't really , you know , you don't push back and you know , start arguing with the guy , especially a pro athlete and your job . But , uh , for me what my priority was is , you know , let them cool down and the next day just hash it out with them . Uh , you know , after practice of like , Hey , we , we good , you know , I wasn't my intent . And I think they appreciate being very upfront in that regard in terms of , uh , just you know , standing what your case was , knowing that there was no harm involved and it was seamless as that the player was like , yeah , no , that was , that was my bad . I didn't , I was seeing red , you know , and a situation like that kind of mapped out . So , and again , you hold no hard feelings there . That's an important part of , uh , the job is those things happen when you're covering guys for nine months out of the year , every single game , those things add up . And sometimes guys just let loose . But it's all about kind of communicating and making sure there's no ill will moving forward as professionals , which I think is the most important thing .","Yeah , this kind of goes in line with the previous question goes question three about , uh , kind of , uh , a difficult project to work on . So when I was up in Alaska for , uh , an extended amount of time working on that feature story , I still had to do the other parts of my job as well , which that was in the middle of the season . So it was still , I'm working about seven hours , uh , for every game night . So usually if it's a normal game situation , if I'm there covering a game , it's , I write a game report then a longer about a thousand word column after every game . So I'm usually , if I'm over at the arena , I'm probably getting home around one , 2:00 AM . So I have to do that on top of kind of these features where it's , again , I'm not on cruise control out in a , in Alaska where it's , I'm still interviewing a lot of , a lot of individuals related to this story . So doing my homework to get a good insightful content , they're getting video B roll , uh , content while I'm out there . So , um , that was tough . And not only that , but you add in , you know , the family aspect of not you being away from home and all these things definitely is tough . There's times where you , you know , you hit the alarm clock , wake up at seven , uh , you have a whole schedule for the day , you have a garment and get this , this , this , this , and this done . And all of a sudden , you know , it's like that and it's nine 30 and you're gassed and you've got same thing through the next day and you can't really even take the time to get a breather more or less . But it makes it difficult . But again , that's part of the job . And when you're able to balance that with working on a project that you're really proud of , usually makes it all worth it in the end .",3.333333333,3,3,3.333333333,2.666666667
36,Pdh3tj4-cwetyk,"Last year we had this situation at work right towards the end of the fiscal year . So we count our fiscal year's kind of from may to April . So right at the end of April , we had kind of a surprise cut to our budget . And so we importantly had to let some individuals go , uh , and kind of restructure our organization and how we hired moving forward . And so of course , this required the unfortunate task of , of having to let people go or to reduce their role and find places for them , uh , in other departments in the organization . And so the steps that we took to adapt were , uh , basically to come together and have a discussion on , uh , who was able to contribute the most to our team . Uh , the second step was to determine the strengths of who we decided not to keep , uh , and make sure that they still had a role in the company to some extent , especially during this time , uh , or during covert times when a lot of people , uh , couldn't find work . Uh , that was really important for us . And then the third was to , uh , take a look at all our budget line items and determine what could stay and what could go . And so this was a period that required substantial adaptability as well as collaboration in order to kind of make the best out of an unfortunate situation .","We had a covert related project that I was managing , uh , that required a lot of resources and not to be turned around kind of in a short period of time . Uh , of course the pandemic , uh , was kind of a situation in which , uh , any informative , uh , you know , materials or documents really needed , uh , to be produced quickly , uh , because the landscape of public health , of , of medicine and so on was changing so rapidly . And so , uh , our project involved developing , um , uh , surveillance and you know , information framework , uh , for the government . And so , uh , we had a very quick turnaround to do this only a couple of weeks , uh , and we didn't yet how many staff members who were sort of designated to that project . Uh , we didn't have any idea as to how the outputs would look . Uh , and so we had a really tough timeline and thus that made the product really hard to achieve , but we were ultimately able to do it . Uh , the reasons for that is that myself and my team decided to , uh , work over time to collaborate , uh , and to work together to kind of bring our best skills forward , see who contribute the most . Um , so in this case , we didn't do any additional hiring . Uh , we just didn't have the timeframe I , in order to do so , but we made sure to delegate , uh , roles appropriately among our existing staff , uh , in order to , uh , achieve , uh , our end goal . And so , luckily we were able to do that on time . It took a lot of extra time , a lot of effort . Um , a lot of , you know , sleepless nights in a sense . But , uh , we were really proud of the end product and we felt like it really ended up having an impact and helping people .","So when he had to make a hiring decision really rapidly and we had two great candidates , uh , one who we actually really preferred , uh , for the position . However , when we , uh , kind of talk to their references as well as to some other people , we did get some information about their past productivity . Now their past productivity , uh , wasn't the result of , you know , any poor behaviors or anything like that . It was due to a recurrent medical condition . Um , and we had to make a decision as to whether we would hire this person , um , because if they had had periods of unproductivity , uh , or needed to go on leave , that would of course affect our other staff members would have to kind of pick up that work where you might need to hire someone in the interim . And so , um , myself and the other individual who were making hiring decisions , uh , had to kind of take this information . So we had some people saying that it may be a difficulty , some people saying that this person , uh , still , you know , would accommodate and make time . And then we had another candidate who maybe wasn't as good as a fit , but perhaps didn't have these same issues . And so we really had to think , you know , what is best for our organization ? Who's going to be the best person ? That scenario , we ended up picking the better candidate and it ended up being the right decision . And although they do struggle sometimes with their health , we ultimately feel like it doesn't really take away from the quality of their work . And so we had this really tough decision to make in terms of whether somebody could be hired because of that , but because we wanted to emphasize , you know , inclusivity and making sure that we were a workplace that was friendly to anyone of all circumstances . B , pick that individual . And I think , uh , we were proven right . Interactions with that person ended up being a really great part of our team , a really great contributor , and we're very happy to have made that decision .","So this high pressure situation was actually , um , quite recent . So , uh , when working with the government , we often get calls from , um , members of the government , uh , pretty directly in order to take action on certain things . And so right now , uh , with COBIT 19 and kind of the , uh , you know , uh , consequences of it and mental health is a big issue in since I work , um , primarily in mental health responses and developing products . Uh , in order to inform public mental health , um , we really had to create something , uh , sort of a resource document , um , for , um , these individuals in government to be able to use , uh , at their next , uh , session . Uh , and so we only have a couple of weeks to do it . Usually something like this realistically would take a lot longer , so more on the couple of months . So , uh , we had a really stressful environment in terms of having to take this task that would normally take us much longer and having to do it in a consolidated timeframe . And so , uh , we have to come up with this report on very short notice . So the way we responded was by , uh , divvying up the tasks . So normally a couple of people work on this report . Now , we had 10 people working on this report . We had a big collaborative document . Uh , we made sure to meet regularly and so on . The outcome of that and by , you know , increasing our collaboration and working together , uh , was that we were able to deliver .","As someone who has more than one job . Uh , so I have , uh , two positions , uh , one in an academic institution in one , um , working for the federal government . Uh , the challenge is sometimes I do have commitments that may overlap and while my superiors are very understanding and obviously accept my situation , it does mean having to decline opportunities that I think are really valuable . And so a really recent experience was when I had the opportunity to serve as a speaker for an equity diversity and inclusion panel . Um , this is something that I'm really passionate about . Um , something that's really important to me , uh , as a woman of color . But unfortunately I also had a very , very critical work meeting , uh , for one of my positions at the same time . Uh , and so I really had to kind of weigh the pros and cons of , you know , attending one over the other and I'll , being a speaker would have been a really great opportunity , something I could put on my CV . Uh , unfortunately that was , uh , something on the side . It wasn't a work priority . And at the end of the day , I did have to prioritize , um , my work and my employment because that's my livelihood . And so , uh , what I did is I tried to notify the organizers as early as possible . Uh , I provided a list of suggested , uh , individuals who maybe would also be a good fit . And so the outcome is , of course , I didn't , uh , end up attending that event , but then selecting a very dear friend of mine and she did a really wonderful job . And so , uh , while I didn't get to be involved in that directly , I was really proud of how that turned out . Uh , I was really happy that I was able to suggest someone , uh , who could also really benefit from that opportunity . And I was also happy at the end of the day , uh , to be able to maintain my work commitments .",3.333333333,4,3,3,4.666666667
37,Ptfiq83-48fgfu,"Our office is typically set up with cubicles and the higher ups decided they want it us to have a more friendly environment allowing us to see one another . So they were going to redesign the cubicles that took away the spacing that you couldn't see anyone . So basically you could stand up and see your neighbor . And that was challenging because people were used to having their own little private areas and not having to see one another . And it was an interesting challenge , but we all ended up enjoying being visible to one another in the office setting .","So one particular instance we , we're trying to do a fundraiser to obtain funds to help a community center . And our goal was two . Yeah . At least $10,000 so yeah , to lay out and a line item of budget to determine , okay . Things we would need to set up in order to make this fundraiser successful . And so the first step was to contact community organizations that will be interested coming to and bringing dollars into the event . The next thing we had to do a survey to see the interest level of the community center and how they wanted to move forward in collecting the funds . And the third step was to ensure that the funds collected would get to the community center via electronic or did they want it in paper for , so we had to determine how they wanted the money to be given to them once all the work was done . So that was one way that we have to work to set goals for a project .","So one particular instance was we had to hire a person that would be over planning for a particular event and yeah , they wanted this person within a week's timeframe . Well , you know , when you're interviewing people , do you want to get the best person for the job ? And the only way to do that is to see multiple people . But with a short timeframe , we had to really hone in on what we wanted from that particular person and have all the detailed qualifications like to so the T before we could decide who we would hire . And so that was a very intensive process too , right ? Those specifications that quickly to get a person within a week to make sure , yeah , they were the right fit . Yeah . For this particular project . And they have the right skillset and the turnaround was quick . So you know , we were interviewing left and right . And finally we were able to narrow it down to our top two and within weeks timeframe we got the top two . And between those two we were able to select the best candidate for the job . And that was a final decision that was made . And that was very quick response to hiring a new person for a row .","So one of the parts of my job is to make sure I go to training so I can honing my skills and get better . Yeah . At managing people . So it can be stressful attending all these trainings and still having to do your job . Mmm . After these trainings and give information . So the powers that be of what you've learned and disperse information to the team . So aye was able to organize my schedule in my time to ensure everything was met . Right . I love the team . No . This is where I'm going to be . I delegated responsibilities to make sure items that I can not cover while I was in trainings was being covered by individuals that were at work . And I did this with Mmm . Open discussion of what are your strengths , what do you think you can fit in helping run the organization in my , in essence absence while I'm in these trainings . And it worked very smoothly because when you're in management you have lots of trainings to make sure , but you are up to date on new ways and advancements in that area of expertise . And the team did an awesome job . Couldn't have done it without them .","You know , there are lots of times when commitments can't be kept when you're a project manager in your over all these different activities that occur . So one particular time there was a budget meeting and you always have to attend those and it actually overlapped right . With a meeting , two meet with some sponsors that were going to help us work with a local community group . And yeah , I had two determined which one would I attend because both of them had equal importance and they both needed to be covered . So what I decided to do was ask my , the person that's always like right under me . Okay . Take the wing of , I'm not sure there to sit in on yeah . Budget meeting to just take notes and give me all the information for budgeting while I attended the meeting with the sponsor to ensure all their needs were met and that we would be able to move forward to get them to help the community . So that was the outcome . Just always being able to hello people and delegate responsibilities . Okay . Part of management and also teamwork . Working with others is huge . You must be able to work with your team to bring the best out in them so they can bring the best out in you . It's not a one on one situation , but it's a situation in which in which you must be willing to give of yourself so that they can shine bright too .

38,Pxvqsbf-9eaiwz,"Well , one time I had to change , um , at work was when we went to start working fully remote . We used to work in an office and then when the pandemic happened a couple of years back , we started working solely a remote and this was different . We're used to working in person asking each other for help , you know , having meetings in person , having that personal comradery . And now it's all zoom and teams and email and phone calls sometimes . And being a leader , I've never led a team , you know , full remote . So I have to adapt to this and make sure I'm still bonding with my team , make sure I'm still connecting with them , that even though you know , we're not in person anymore , but they can still count on me , I can still lead them effectively . You know , it was difficult at first , you know , but I think we've gotten used to it and my team is able to count on me and I'm still able to lead effectively . There's still certain stuff that I like to do in person . Then you know , on teams or zoom calls , WebEx , you know , whatever you want to do . But you know , I think we've overcome this , you know , cause they had to get used to it as well . I think we're in a good place and I think my leadership capabilities does carry over too . The remote aspect .","So for , for one of my projects was to get , I wanted a 90% , um , completion rate from my leads to making a sale . So all the leads I gather and you know , go through them and try to get that sale . I want to 90% of my leads converted to a sale . And this is condo . I've set goals in the past and this is really one I've wanted to do . I've never did it in my career . You know , a lot of people , it's hard to do that just because of all the barriers aspects out there when you're trying to make a sale . But the steps I took was instead of just gathering as many leads as I can , hundreds and hundreds and just , you know , trying to hit just a few of them is I really focused on gaining the best leads that I can . You know , maybe I wouldn't get as many leads , but for this month I wanted to try to convert 90% . All was more focused on quality versus quantity . So it took me to research the leads , make sure these leads , um , would be good for me . And looking at the characteristics of the demographics I'm going to be working with , making sure , you know , I'm able to connect with them . So it was a lot more , there was a lot more investigation of the leads itself than just gathering , you know , as many as I can , you know ? So it was a lot of work , but I ended up hitting it . I didn't get as many , you know , cells as I did , but for that month I wanted to see , you know , if I can do that , to investigate the leads and , yeah . And I did .","At a previous job when I worked at a pharmacy , I was dealt with the , I needed to make a quick decision . My boss wasn't there , the head pharmacist wasn't there in a , in a patient was , was calling in to see if they could get , you know , a fill on their medication and now reached out to my boss . And then I reached up to hit a pharmacist and they were telling me a couple of different differing information . Yeah . You know , they can fill it , we can get in , uh , um , simple fill until you know , the weak kids and they can get more of a permanent feel to have a loss was like , no , they can't get this bill for for certain reasons , you know , she wanted a certain reason . So here my boss was saying one thing , the head pharmacist over the pharmacy I work with while not my direct boss , he's kind of over the pharmacy . So I have to kind of , you know , decide what to do . So I ended up researching a little myself and I'm asking a few of the texts and getting some more information in , in more the information sided with the head pharmacist , and he is over the whole pharmacy . So , you know , I went with his decision over my boss , even though I kind of felt like I was , you know , going around or , um , in a way . But working in that industry is , is very customer focused . So I needed to make sure this person could , you know , get their meds filled .","So working in insurance and sales , it's especially end of quarters , um , ind of years is very high pressured .

Are you going to get , you know , their promotion , are you going to get the raise or your for my agency are we gonna meet our quotas ? And it's very high pressure , but you have to learn how to stay calm under that . Um , you have to , because working in a calm environment I think produces the best outcomes . So that's the first thing is , is , is working as calm as possible . If you start panicking and fretting , then you can get , dig yourself deeper into a hole . But really the best way to handle those situations is just take care of your work as the months and years progress . And so it's not as high pressure when you get to those end of the months or you're not having to scramble to try to make up for inferior performance in the past . That that's the best way . I know , that's what I communicate to my team is just be calm . Um , this will pass .

They never sent me any type of reminder , which is , which is always something I like . I ended up just signing off and those commitments took priority over that . And I admit that it's , it was probably not the right thing to do , but you know , in the moment I had to take care of this stuff and yeah , I put them on the back burner and I ended up realizing it at the end of the night , you know , after I got out of the shower , I was like , Oh wait , I was supposed to help so-and-so . And I sent them a personal text message . Mmm . You know , saying I'm sorry and that we can connect first thing in the morning . They did appreciate that , but I did reach out personally to them and acknowledged that I did miss that meeting . So everything was smoothed over . Everything was good .

39,Pnpvrtp-ferigm,"Um , so we were having budget cuts in our state . Um , I used to work for a nonprofit and we relied on government funds to help us with , um , our funding due to being nonprofit status . Um , and so due to the budget cuts within our state , um , and being the fact that we were nonprofit , um , of course we were increasing our fundraising efforts . Um , but also , uh , we found that we needed to adapt by , um , increasing the intake of , uh , non English speaking clients . So , uh , we were used to up to that point , um , only serving , you know , English speaking client , client clientele . Um , however we found that , um , the demographics in our area were changing and so we needed to serve , uh , people who spoke Spanish or other languages . And so , um , I was able to adapt by using my , you know , middle school and high school Spanish courses , um , to be able to help , uh , translate and help interprets . Um , I was able to translate some documents that I had created , um , that were in English into Spanish . Um , and I was able to help edit , um , the documents that my coworkers had written into Spanish . So I was happy to use my language skills , uh , to help out during that transition period , uh , at our , at our workplace . So I felt that I was able to contribute a lot due to the fact that I had , uh , many different , you know , positive traits that I could bring to the table . And , uh , yeah , it , it went well . We were able to adapt to that and , um , you know , hire more bilingual staff and we're able to , um , serve a more diverse clientele from that point on . So , yeah , it definitely had a positive income outcome . Sorry .","My supervisor told me that I needed to start , um , taking over the responsibilities of training staff at my workplace . And so I was not familiar with how to do that . I had never done that before . I've never trained staff before , but I definitely have a lot of initiative and creativity and so , uh , and determination . So , um , one of the things I needed to train our staff on was the Heimlich maneuver . I had seen , um , the previous staff member who I replaced , uh , do that training . And , um , I felt that most people didn't quite understand , um , how to do the Heimlich maneuver at the end of it because there was not a lot of hands on exercises . Um , and so it was , I felt that people were not really listening to the presentation and it just kind of went over their heads . And so I learned from that and , um , you know , it was definitely , um , daunting for me to , you know , figure out how am I going to do this ? How am I going to reach people so that people understand how to do this and , uh , take it away with them to where they will be able to REM remember these steps in an emergency situation . So I just , I tried to put myself in their shoes , um , and I felt that , uh , the way that people learn is , uh , not just like auditorily , um , but also visually and kinesthetically . So I felt like it was good to get people moving active and that that is how people are gonna remember things like muscle memory and that sort of thing . So , so first I used a , um , I looked up on Google . Um , you know , how to make a model of lungs . I use some balloons , some Play-Doh , some straws , um , a two liter bottle and a made a model of lungs that had something stuck in the , you know , trachea . And I , I showed how , you know , when you push on the diaphragm , you're basically like , kind of like pushing the lungs , the air out of the lungs to dislodge the thing out of their trachea to so that the person can expel the item . And people really enjoyed that demonstration . And then I had people practice the Heimlich maneuver on each other with proper technique . And people really praise me for that , um , entire model because , uh , they were able to remember and use that in future instances . So I was very pleased with that .","Yeah . Um , so unfortunately one time , uh , one of our clients came in with some suspicious looking , um , bruises on their arms . Um , and the client was also upset and on the verge of tears . And , um , but unfortunately also this client's had some , um , mental , um , disabilities . And so , uh , it was difficult for them to answer questions and interact way . Um , they had developmental disabilities as well . Um , and so there were different coworkers of mine who were suggesting different things . Uh , some were saying that we should , um , you know , just interview the clients , uh , immediately . Some people were saying that we needed to immediately call , um , adult protective services . Um , some people were saying we should call the group home that the client was living in to ask them about the bruises and ask them if they knew anything about it . Um , so I knew that what we needed to prioritize was to first calm the client down and , you know , help them , um , to be peaceful again and not be crying and to kind of comfort them . That was the most important thing , um , to do . Um , then next , uh , we did need to interview the client with non-leading questions with open ended questions so that they could , uh , answer to the best of their ability . Um , you know , what , what happens or if they remembered how they got those bruises . Um , also we had to look into , you know , what is the pattern of bruising ? Like what , um , just stated in a very matter of fact , way , like , not read into it , but just describe the size and shape of the bruising and the coloring of the bruising and to yes , immediately make a adult protective services reports , um , and to call them , to let them know , um , that yes , uh , calling the group home would be something that would be done through the adult protective services departments , uh , not directly from us . So , uh , yes , I had to kind of talk to my coworkers and describe to them that this is the correct chain of events that needs to occur . And so we were able to calm the client down and reported it to adult protective services and they were able to handle it from there .","Um , so a particularly stressful situation that happened at work , uh , was that one of our clients , um , he , he does have autism , um , and he , um , is moderately high functioning . Um , but he was having a tough day and , um , he started verbally and physically , um , attacking and trying to attack people , um , in his classroom . So he was a rather large man . Uh , he was an adult . He was probably around 300 pounds or so and about six feet tall . Um , so , uh , physically daunting . Um , and so it was definitely a very tough day , um , for , you know , all the staff and the clients as well . We had to , you know , immediately clear , clear the classroom , um , of all the clients evacuate them . We had to , um , you know , move furniture to try to help keep the client safe from hurting themselves as well . Um , yes , it was very , very stressful not knowing , you know , how this person was going to act or respond . Uh , their behavior was very erratic , um , and unpredictable and , um , just trying our best to deescalate the situation and help them calm down and , um , just also trying to call their parents to see if maybe they might've missed their dose of medication or anything like that recently . Um , seeing if there had been any triggers from home cause it happened , um , early in the morning , like right when the client arrived to the day program . So we were really confused as to what triggered this . And so , um , yes it was a really difficult situation helping them calm down , but um , we were able to calm them down probably it's probably took about an hour to calm them down . Um , we were just taking evasive techniques to keep ourselves safe and also to keep them safe as well . Um , we just , we didn't want to escalate the situation , so yes , after about an hour we were able to calm them down . Um , and then , and then eventually their parents did pick them up , uh , early from the school situation , and then they were able to , you know , go home and get some rest and kind of get their medications readjusted , um , by their , uh , medical doctor . And then they were able to return to the program later on and were okay after that .","Um , some of my coworkers were asking me for help with their documents to help translate them into Spanish . Um , and I had volunteered to help them and I did want to help them with that as well . Um , however , I did have more pressing engagements regarding , um , some of our clients , parents had arrived and needed to speak with me regarding some behavior issues that their , um , son was having . And also , um , another parent who was wanting to talk to me regarding some changes in their daughter's medication and needed to talk to me about like how to , um , make sure that the paperwork was all up to date with regards to their doctor and everything like that because I was the one in charge of record keeping , uh , regarding doctor's offices , notices and that sort of thing to make sure that everything was legal and you know , up to par , uh , regarding our facility . So , so I had to unfortunately tell my coworkers that I had more pressing engagements regarding parents that needed to speak to me immediately . And I always felt like , you know , customer service , um , because I was , you know , a customer service facing role . So I always felt like that was my priority and I had to triage that and make sure that , you know , our clientele was all happy and you know , satisfied with our services because , um , yeah , we , we are the ones serving them . And so I had to tell my coworkers that I needed to help them at a later date , um , and to ask them to wait a little bit longer until I had time to help them translate those documents into Spanish . So they understood that , you know , talking to parents was first and foremost , and they were able to wait and I was able to help them , uh , the next day with that . And then everything all worked out well .",3.666666667,4,3.5,3.666666667,3.333333333
40,P8y984x-a8xn94,"Okay . So I experienced a highly adaptive environment and a constantly changing environment . Back when I worked as a manager at target , we had just installed a large grocery sesh , uh , section , uh , to the far end of the store , including huge banks of freezers , fresh produce , everything you'd seen a supermarket more or less . And unfortunately this was a massive shift in our logistics . We started getting food trucks multiple times a week . We had to train everybody on the staff on how to handle that . And it was on me to get this retraining and this remodel process going as a mid level manager there . So I took it step by step . I figured priority one was to make sure that all team members were comfortable with the remodeling environment , understanding that they would have to talk to our customers about the process and the noises they might be hearing and everything else . And also tried to train our team members to educate our customers as well on what to expect from the area that we're adding to the store or we were adding to the store . Excuse me . Um , so educating the team members was the first big step . And then after that it was all about training them on the new area , more or less , teaching them how to , uh , inspect , produce properly , handle the temperatures , deal with cooler leaks , everything associated with the grocery department essentially . So by , by , by breaking it up into the , into those two key steps , I was able to kind of divide the workload and prevent myself from overwhelming the team members .","Well in my current capacity as a video game level designer and developer , I experienced multiple setbacks on a routine basis because I don't work for any large companies . And as a result , there are a lot of kind of low budget projects , uh , maybe people who are working part time and suddenly become unavailable for art commissions or programming , things like that . So it's , it's constantly trying to fit a square peg into a round hole . It's certainly not a well oiled machine with an easy schedule . So I can pull many examples from this line of work . Um , the one I'm going to pick involves a large game , I won't say , but it was made by , uh , a team of really talented artists and , um , it was published on console and it was extremely popular . However , the issue was I had to basically design every area in the game . Like they'll do the level design for the whole game in three months and we're , we're talking 600 hours of work , easily five to 600 . So , you know , lots and lots of long days . Um , so obviously it's hard to achieve that in such a tight timeframe . So the key step was to actually delegate . I had to have a helper essentially . Um , so I was forthcoming about it . I mentioned that I needed to divide the workload . I couldn't handle it myself and that they would just have to bite the bullet and bring in a worker . And that was the key first step . And then after that I train them on what I wanted to do . I worked closely with them and I gave them the easier areas , well , easier relative to me . Like I tackled the areas that I knew it would be challenging so that they could focus more on getting out the stuff that just needed to , the areas that just needed to be made , like towns and caves , you know , areas that didn't really involve a lot of asset editing or puzzle design , you know , stuff you would see in more complicated areas in a video game . So that was pretty much how I handled that . And it worked quite well .","Okay . So I was working on another game , uh , for a small studio and I still do some stuff for them . But the communication is a little inconsistent . And in particular , you know , the artists might want one thing , but the programmer wants something else and both of them have vested interest in the game . Both have invested their own kind of creative energies . They're not just hired guns , they've worked on the story . So they all have kind of a , a stake in the prize , so to speak . They want to see the game succeed because you know , several of the characters are , there's , you know , so it's kind of like a melting pot of creativity . And when you don't , when you have that situation and there are no higher guns , you're going to get conflicting ideas on how to handle the level design in the game . Because both want to cater to maybe their , the stuff they wrote , maybe the characters they wrote or the , the area of the world that they developed , you know , the world building that that was kind of their pet project , you know , so . So you have to try to cater to both of them and keep them happy . But that can conflict if the story requires a specific area , like let's say they have to go investigate some minds and the programmer wants to have like a huge character death there . Yet the artist wants to keep it kind of low key and , and it feels like not only am I going to meetings with people for , you know , with the art department or the programming department , but I'm also dealing with the writers at the same time . So ultimately what I , what I decided to do was create the areas independent of the story and then hand them off to them and discuss how they want to incorporate them into the story that way . I presented myself from becoming a cook in that kitchen , an extra cook in that kitchen . I just made the areas they can use them however they see fit and if they want modifications that they can get back to me . And that's how I avoided that nonstop conflict .","I experienced a very high stress situation , uh , senior year of high school and going way back now when I hadn't even started my summer reading a week before the end of the summer . So I pretty much had to read three books that week and write three papers . You know , we're talking 60 , 70 hours of , of work essentially in that one week . And that was the last week of my summer . I learned a hard lesson . Um , I dealt with it by just breaking it into bite sized chunks . Every day I set a goal and a quota . I would read half the first book , day one and the second half , day two and so on and so forth . And then I also staggered the reading and the writing . So after I read the first book , I did the first paper and then I started reading the second book . That way I didn't burn out on a particular activity or get the information mixed up . That's how I divided and conquered that . Project management is all about time and motion studies , charting out where the critical paths are in the development and the manufacturing or the supply chain or whatever your , whatever kind of project you're managing , and you have to divide it up into those segments and figure out the critical path . And that's what I did way back in high school without realizing it . And it worked out quite well . Um , I managed to complete all the assignments . I got A's on every single one of them , and , uh , I ended up in the honor society that year , so it ended up being a good year despite the procrastination .","Okay , well , going back to the a large game I worked on , the largest game I've ever worked on , I committed to working on the optional areas of that game . And in hindsight , there was no way I was going to be able to do them and the main areas and those three months and I was in way over my head . Um , so that was the situation and what I decided to do is just be forthcoming about it . You know , I had the helper , I'm like , you know , maybe we should offload these onto my assistant or I could come back and do them later on another smaller commission , um , after the main game had been made . So I gave them multiple options that they could choose from . And ultimately they chose to do those areas in house after they let them percolate a bit more because they were running tight on funds at the time . And I can understand that completely . It was probably better for me to do that than to say I could do it and then never do it , you know ? Um , so I'm pretty happy that I kind of took the loss there . Um , it worked out well and I'm sure they were happy about not just the work I did , but the optional errors that they made in house .",3.333333333,3,3,3.666666667,2.666666667
41,Pvvwvxf-863ciy,"So recently at work , we took another digital step and , uh , decided to , uh , help our customers with , um , online ordering and curbside . Um , and this was in direct response to Kobe , uh , where people , we didn't want them if they were especially , um , elderly or were more risk with Cub permitted to be , we're abilities , uh , to , um , come into the store . Uh , so the ideas that they could , um , just make their order and then pull up curbside and we would run the order out . Uh , but what this entailed is that , um , everything had to be right , um , in inside the store . So , um , inventory had to be correct if the customer was looking at our inventory online and had to be up to date . If , uh , two people were trying to buy the same one item that we had left , uh , it had to have the first item . The first customer had to be , um , um , would have it in their cart . The second item would be cut off . They couldn't buy it anymore . So we had to work out . Glitches is , I guess my point , uh , while that was happening with corporate . Uh , but inside the store we , uh , did we could to make sure inventory was correct , that our team members were trained , um , and that they understood that this was the new wave of the future is not going away . So , uh , when the buzzer goes off on the tail zone and we have a new order to procure a , we have a certain amount of time . I was proud of myself that we got that , um , that we would finish the order up in record time . And then when the customer , um , showed up in a parking lot and said they were here , that we would run that out to them also in record time , uh , with a smile on our face , just as if we were serving a customer that was coming inside the store . Um , we also did , uh , several incentive , um , offered several incentives to , uh , to make this online and curbside , um , uh , rollout effective . Um , uh , meaning that for a while it was extremely popular because , uh , would actually be , uh , the customers would save more money by doing the online option , uh , because if they spent so much money , they would get money back to spend in , um , again in the store . Um , so a lot of people try this out and we wanted to make sure , um , that , you know , you only get one first impression and that w that we know that and , uh , hit it out of the park every time , uh , to , uh , keep that customer coming back and happy and telling others about our services , uh , which , uh , was very successful .","So recently , uh , corporate asked us to change 8,000 prices . Uh , our store sells a 10,000 items , so virtually every area of the store was , um , was touched . Uh , the idea was that if we could lower our prices , um , that that would be the perception would be that while all of our competitors were going up , uh , we were going down and so that we would be the , uh , ideal destination that people would , uh , think about , uh , when they were interested , uh , to pull this off , uh , borrowed , um , um , from the , the back of house , uh , not just the front of house , which I primarily engaged with , um , to make sure that we could get the , our worked on time . Um , we had to move , uh , certain , um , people and their priorities around to make it happen . Um , but the icing on the cake is that when the , uh , County came in to look at our price changes , I'm sorry , to , to , to make sure that the prices were correct , um , that we passed with flying colors . So corporate was happy , our legal obligations were happy , and I've made sure to praise the team . And let them know , uh , couldn't have done it without you and thank you and pass it around those attaboys out of girls , which everybody appreciates that recognition because it was a job well done . And , um , we , you know , it was hard , but we , we accomplished our task .","Recently at the store , I had to make a decision about some conflicting information . A customer was returning a product , uh , to the store . Um , and my team wasn't exactly sure how to handle it . I had one , uh , manager , uh , advise me one way , um , and then a , a newer , uh , manager advise me , uh , another way . And uh , and the newer manager was , was correct . I confirmed that online with our policy . Uh , but the older manager , uh , was remembering , um , a way that we used to do things before I took over and with a different manager and it was our former policy . Um , in the end , the , the customer , um , uh , left happy , um , we did what we could to , um , ensure that they would , that they would return . Um , just had to take the , you know , the , the information , make us what decision , um , make sure that I was acting , uh , with , uh , with , uh , respect to all person . Uh , all , all personnel that was , was talking to me on my team as well as providing the best customer service , um , that we are known for . And , um , making sure that the customer wasn't inconvenienced more than necessary . Uh , while I've ascertained the answer .","So a couple of weeks ago , um , my boss asked me to manage a store downtown . Um , that was recently , um , uh , hit with , um , um , um , robberies , um , return robberies . Um , so the , the place was boarded up , the team was stressed . Um , that store does not have a current store manager . So I was just going in there and visiting . Uh , but I did the best that I could to , um , ensure everybody , uh , that , uh , during my time there while I was helping out that , um , that we would be safe , secure , uh , listen to their , um , experiences . They're there . Um , you take their feedback back to , to my boss , back to corporate , um , um , let them know that we were listening to them and their concerns . And even though it was a fairly stressful situation , um , did my best to represent , um , myself well and um , let them , let them know at that visiting store , uh , that I was on their side and that their , their safety , their protection , um , was the highest , you know , the most important thing to me . Um , but also got to know them and ask about their , um , how they were doing , um , with recurring break-ins and things of that nature , uh , alongside with cupboard and , um , other , other restrictions . So , um , even though it was fairly stressful , uh , did the best that I could to present myself well and treat others the way that I would want to be treated .","The other day my boss came to do a routine , um , um , walkthrough , um , basically make sure that the store is operating properly , uh , that the , the , the team's happy , the customers are being taken care of . Uh , the stores clean , neat , organized and that I'm doing my job . Um , it was a surprise inspection and I didn't know that he would be coming . Um , but at the same time , um , I had plans with my wife and um , and didn't want to , um , uh , delay or inconvenience her as well . Um , so , um , basically made the best out of that situation , uh , compromised with the , um , the district manager , um , went through all of our steps , um , although at a more brisk pace than usual . Um , I had followed through with the previous , uh , recommendations for my store , so I was all up to date and um , was , was able to meet my commitments , um , to um , presenting myself well at the store , um , having buttoned up all of the previous , uh , suggestions , uh , as well as , um , making sure that my wife wasn't , uh , disappointed , um , and able to make my dinner appointment as well .

42,P4qeget-hypppd,"Um , I worked at a secure facility for juveniles who had committed crimes and , um , the environment was always changing as far as , uh , residents for being admitted . And then they had served their time and then they could leave . And then sometimes staff retired or left for another state position . And so we would train new staff . And I did some , I helped a lot of , um , training , especially female staff . And I really enjoy training military veterans because they're always cooperative and they always have your back and they always work as a team and they're awesome . And , um , so that was probably one of the challenges that we had was um , training new staff and , um , so I would just , you know , work with some of the new staff and some of them were pretty street smart and so they didn't need a lot of help or mentoring , especially the ones who had been in the military . And then other , other ones who had just gotten out of college and maybe they didn't have life experience . And , uh , the main thing that is important to me is that you want to look , you want to appear to be confident in that kind of job because you're working with residents who , some of them are in gangs and you just want to appear confident so they respect you . Even if you're not confident in yourself , you have to appear that way . And so , and part of that was , you know , I am helping to train staff . I would maybe give feedback in a positive way and never be condescending and maybe give them ideas . You know , like I had had training in a jail before I worked there . You know , how to stand behind a door in front of a door when you're entering a room . And um , just basic safety and security things that people might not think about until they work in a place like that . And , uh , those things helped to build confidence in the new staff . And then also the residents appreciate that because they want to know that they're at a safe environment . That's very important And you want to get along with alpha male as far as the residents are concerned , that's also very important . .","After I retired , I downsized and I sold my house in the country and I bought a mobile home that was a fixer upper . And so I lived in it for about a year and I worked on it and then I sold it for twice what I paid for it . And then I bought another fixer upper mobile home for about 15,000 . And I worked on it for about a year and I sold it for about 33,000 . And then I sold that and I bought another mobile home for 13,000 and it needed a lot of work and it took me two or three years to work on it , but I finally got it done . And at the same time I was working online and , um , I did a lot of work and I hired a handyman and maintenance people to help me with projects . And I did a lot of the painting myself . I had the bathroom , um , you know , like a new bathtub , new kitchen cabinet , new kitchen sink , all the basic things that you want to do when you update a home . And then I sold it for like 60,000 , like two or three years later . And then I moved to Georgia . So I moved from Washington state to Georgia and I did it by myself . I , um , I got rid of a lot of furniture that I didn't really need and cause when you rehabilitate homes , I had already downsized and you don't need a lot of things . Like I could just , I was basically living out of boxes during that time . So I loaded up my stuff . What I did , I did have an a U haul and I , uh , flew across country and that I had the you haul , deliver the , you haul , um , box . And now I'm looking for another , I'm living in a , in an apartment and I'm looking for another , um , house to buy it as a fixer upper . And my daughter's mother-in-law is a real estate agent and she'll be helping me to find a fixer upper that I can work on . And I live near a military base , so I'm not really worried about being able to sell it when I'm done with it or I might just stay in it . I don't know . I haven't decided yet . I'd like to put the , You know , um , I'd like to have a place for my granddaughter to come visit so we can play games and hang out , and I would really enjoy that .","When I moved here to Georgia , I had been on a waiting list for , um , housing that was subsidized and it's for people 55 and older . And then I went to a couple of interviews and I have good credit . I have , I've always paid my rent . I don't have a criminal background . And I kind of figured out that maybe they don't want to rent to me because I'm the wrong color . So , um , I was pretty disappointed because it's near where my daughter lives and I was looking forward to living closer to my daughter . And , um , so I live in this apartment that's very affordable and , but it's not where I want to stay . So that's when I decided , well , I need to buy a house then . And I talked to my , um , the other grandma , my daughter's mother-in-law , and I talked to her about buying something that I could afford and she said , yeah , there are houses that come on the market that are maybe fixer uppers or flipped foreclosures . And , um , so I pre qualify for a home loan and so I'll be able to , um , look for a house to buy . And I really excited about it actually because maybe this way I could earn some money because I've done it before . I bought fixer uppers and I sold them and I thought I was done doing that . But , um , it's okay , I can keep working . I actually kind of enjoyed working around the house and working on projects and it gave me something to do . It keeps me in shape . I'm not just sitting around . So it's actually a good thing . And another thing about the senior , um , apartments is that everybody was wearing masks and masks were required and I don't wear masks . So that's actually a good thing that kind of turned out that way cause I don't want somebody to tell me what to do and what to wear , you know ? So I think it's a face diaper and it's ridiculous . I , you know , I worked in jobs in hospitals and I worked with tuberculosis patients and I worked with juveniles from all over the world who had , you know , all kinds of diseases and I , not one time was offered a mask . And of course I follow basic safety , like washing my hands before I use the restroom , which a lot of people don't do that . But that's something you really want to do when you work in a discussing environment . So anyway , I'm really excited . I've , um , I'll just , it's a lot of work looking for a house to buy , but I'm really excited about it and I look forward to making an offer on a house .","I started working at the secure facility for juveniles and 2006 was it . And then , um , the governor of Washington state was elected in 2012 , I believe . And he , um , wanted to change how a lot of things were done and it was very stressful and , um , I actually developed health problems due to the stress . Um , and so what I decided to do was to look for another job , but then I realized that they were hiring people who are younger than I was . And so I decided to retire early and rehabilitate homes instead . And then I work online to earn money and my health problems have gotten a lot better since I decided to leave that stressful environment . And a lot of people retired when I left . And , um , it was a good decision and I'm happy that I made that decision and beings that I don't work for the state of Washington anymore . I was able to move here to Georgia and spend time with my granddaughter and I'm really happy that I was able to do that . And , um , I remember my grandmother spending time with me and my sister , and now I get to spend time with my granddaughter and it , it really means a lot . And , um , my daughter would like to have another kid , but man , it's , nobody can afford it nowadays . And the medical choices we have now are pretty horrible . So , um , yeah . So I'm pretty happy with the decision I made to just leave and retire early . You know what they say ? You can't fight city hall and , um , I'm not , I wasn't young and energetic anymore , so I just decided to bail . And I had trained new staff before I left . So that's something I did do before I left . .","I wanted to move to Georgia in 2016 but I felt like I wanted to earn some money by flipping houses and also my health wasn't that great yet . And so I decided to wait one or two or three years . And so I finally did move here last summer . And um , so , you know , I had wanted to help my daughter more with , uh , when she had her kid , but I just wasn't able to do to my own health and due to financial reasons . But she has her other mother-in-law here and there are other family members . So that made me feel better . And so , um , my mom and dad still live in Washington state and they might move to Arizona because Washington state is not a good place to live right now . So , um , I'm looking forward to where I live now . I can , you know , it's the weather's pretty good all year long . We can go swimming or go to the beach or there are a lot of activities . The park is , you know , you can go there pretty much all year . The weather here is it gets hot , but it doesn't get really cold . Like it doesn't wash it in state . So I really , I really like it . Um , I remember a few times being snowed in in Washington state and not being able to leave my house , but I don't really deal with that here in Georgia . But we do have thunder and lightening and rain storms , but that's all right . I can deal with that .",3.333333333,1.666666667,1.333333333,1.666666667,1
43,Ppp3yfd-2ykw8i,"Uh , several years ago in my prior role as a senior manager , Apple , I was in charge of the launch of the Apple watch . Uh , so Apple watch in which you can see where pretty much all of us are wearing at this point . Uh , it was a brand new product . We'd never seen it . And on launch day , uh , we'd only interacted with it for maybe a couple of days . And learning was still very much an unknown quantity about what we knew and what the clients knew . Uh , because there was manufacturing issues with , uh , watch . Uh , we actually had several weeks of owning a trial period rather than immediate release . And that was only announced to us probably the morning of or the day before . So essentially all the launch plans that I had created as a senior manager for the red zone , uh , had to be redeveloped in the moment , uh , the day before and the day of . Uh , luckily , you know , people at Apple are very resilient and very adaptive . And it was , uh , really a great scenario . So I had about five managers , I think at the time reporting to me . So kind of bringing them all together , um , sharing with them what the new paradigm was as we had to , uh , evaluate that . So , uh , really on the fly , we were able to , one , create a training plan for our team , uh , to develop a new Tryon program as well as capture all of the clientele . So what would happen , instead of selling a client a watch that they could take on that day , we actually had to take them to a computer where they could order the watch through the Apple store and have that sent to them . Uh , it was a very different type of scenario that we'd ever done before . And , uh , one thing I'm most proud of is that we attracted NPS scores , uh , with Apple and that , uh , we ended up at 90% for our clientele being happy with , uh , their experience from training .","I think , uh , the best example would also be Apple . Uh , as a senior manager , the Redstone , one of the things we really struggled with was , uh , Apple care attachment for our , uh , for our iPhones . So we were one of the busiest stores in the entire company , but a lot of our clientele , we were based in Orlando , came from Brazil and other parts of South America . And you would from Europe where Apple care was that transferable . However , there was still a large part of the American clientele that we were not getting food or so used to not offering it and always getting no the team . So sort of stopped offering it . So , uh , I was able to sit with my team and develop a plan . We were able to kind of identify who were the team members that were consistently kind of outperforming store average , and then use them as a leverage point to sort of reach out and take some of the newer people under their wings or even some of the more tenured people under their wings and sort of raise that bar of expectations . So , um , although we never really hit company average , which would have been very challenging with the of clientele we had , we were still able to almost double our iPhone penetration for Apple care and went from like 20% , almost 39% . Uh , just new studies available on prolific .","I think one of the experiences I had was thinking about my time at both steak and shake and checkers where I had to deal with a lot of , um , I guess pilot programs . So , uh , because of my performance and expertise , um , from a project management standpoint , um , my area was often selected to pilot programs , whether it be magic menu or salads or fruit frozen or milkshakes or whatever it may be . And because it's a pilot program , they often don't know what we don't know , right . So essentially you're given packets of information from the train department . That's our outline , how things should work . Uh , but then you have to train several layers of the organization usually . So me as the director of operations , you know , working with my train department to train the district managers and store managers and the store managers are required to then go back to their teams and train . There are lots of different ways that we were able to sort of disseminate the information very quickly . But it also happens on launch day . Like when you roll out those things , you're like , Oh my gosh , what we thought was going to happen doesn't work . Right . Either equipment doesn't work . Um , the training didn't work . And so this was also , you know , 14 years ago where technology wasn't the same . It wasn't as easy to disperse lots of information , you know , through group chats and , you know , email and all those different things a little bit more challenging . Um , so the , the thing with pilot programs , sometimes they're not successful or it's sometimes you love something and it's a train wreck and it's not because the operators did anything wrong . It was just the whole process itself was wrong cause he had to dial back and , and go forward against . Um , so , uh , you know , at the end of the day what , you just have to make sure it's that the team feels okay and feels confident that they did the best job they could , that customers do not have a bad experience because that's what that whole part of the program was about is like figuring out how you do all those things . Um , so , um , you know , had mostly very positive outcomes . So at steak and shake , um , fruit and frozen yogurt milkshakes rolled forward company-wide , uh , salads rolled out company wide and , uh , fresh chicken pulled out . Companywide checkers metric menu did not roll out a company wide . Uh , so very proud of my team and , and how they were able to be reasonably in those very challenging environments .","I think of the times that I'm thinking about a high pressure situation with a target target was a very challenging environment at the time when I was there for about two years . Uh , really high expectations for performance and uh , hitting certain metrics . Um , but also we weren't necessarily given the resources that you needed in order to hit those high metrics . There are several times throughout my tenure there that , um , were really challenging from an outside issue standpoint . So hurricanes at power outages and so like all the food and all the frozen food recruiter for you having to spoil and you have to like throw away . I'll upon , I'll have food and then restock and when it came in and they would only give you like 40 hours to do all those things and you needed more like 200 , so you had to kind of scrape it together from other places . And um , at the end of the day he sort of had to like think through , okay , what are the things that need to happen ? How do I want to make sure that they happen ? Uh , you know , creating a plan with the team , identifying what are all the trigger points , what's the most important thing it has to happen . Um , you know , so in , in , you know , restocking refrigerators and those sorts of things , like you only have like one case of everything out and you can sort of like make depth happen , uh , you know , further along . But you didn't want to be out of stock of things for a long period of time because then people will change their shopping habits , you know , um , you know , thinking about target , competing with Publix or Walmart or anything else like that . So those places have generators . They didn't lose power . They didn't lose their food . Um , so we wanted to make sure that we were open for our business , for our clientele immediately after the hurricanes , even if even if our other competitors weren't open , we need to be able to provide that for our community .","That'd be hard pressed to think of a time where I was not able to keep my commitment at work . I think one of the things that I really sort of pride myself on , my ability to assess what's going on in the world around me , right . What are my resources or availability ? Um , and then as a salary manager , you just often have to just work some of those extra hours . So similarly at target , we had a lot of changeover , right ? So the 24 hour , 48 hour resets in the Christmas or 24 40 hour resets in the Easter . Yes . Red bulldoze and , and , uh , and sort of push your way through . So it's the same way of sort of allocating those resources . In that case , it's going to be labor , right ? What does it need to be done today and could be done with later on , you know , or to do the things that need to be done today . Um , so sometimes you have to Rob from Peter to pay Paul . Um , but it all sort of comes back , uh , in the end .",4.333333333,3.333333333,2.666666667,3.666666667,2.666666667
44,Pecqx79-4vasqg,"Hello . Um , so it's actually very common , um , in my line of work , uh , to have to , um , kind of roll with all of the changes and adapt to , um , different work environments and just the changing marketplace , um , with a background in manufacturing . Um , you know , constantly , uh , consumer demands are changing on a daily basis . Uh , you know , the whole COBIT pandemic , uh , really took a toll on that as well as far as , um , you know , demand and what our next steps were going to be . Um , just as a company overall . So , uh , I mean even in recent history , you know , we still haven't fully recovered from everything that has happened , um , when the initial Colbert pandemic , uh , took place . So , um , I'd say this is something that I frequently , um , deal with . So I mean , basically what steps I take is just , I mean , you kind of have to just go with the flow and accept the changes for what they are . Um , you know , I have ran into a few , um , associates at work who were very hesitant as far as , uh , change and , you know , really did not want to accept or adapt to those environments . But , you know , I kinda just went and went into it with an open mind . Um , and I just , I set all my goals and said , okay , this is what we were going to achieve . Um , and yeah , I just took it day by day and I mean , continued to grow with the company , um , and just , you know , follow what the consumers were looking for and following all of their demands .","So one particular situation that comes to mind was when I had to do a physical audit of the entire manufacturing floor . Um , pretty much single handedly . Uh , our , unfortunately a couple people in our department , um , had other opportunities and moved on from the company which left us short staffed and kind of in a rough situation . Um , however , uh , audits and things like that still take place , you know , regardless of , um , you know , who , who you have working in the department . So my boss sent me , um , with the goal , um , which I will only accepted to count and physically observe 2,400 , some physical assets that are out on the manufacturing floor . So what I did , I kind of just took it section by section . Um , you know , I went on the floor , did one section , um , at once , wrote down what I could find , what I couldn't find , talk to the people . That was one of the most important things . Communication with those that you work with is super important and you can really learn so much about things that maybe you might not see every day . I mean , myself personally , I sit behind a desk behind a computer for most of my days , you know , um , working in a finance department , you deal a lot with , um , you know , spreadsheets and analytics and stuff like that , but really , um , you know , when you have the opportunity to go out on the manufacturing floor , do things that are kind of out of your line of scope of what you would normally do . Um , I mean , that really is just , I that helps you learn so much . And I really enjoyed doing that . Um , it was a very stressful situation . There were quite a few situations where I was like , okay , I can't find these . And I'd get a little bit frustrated from time to time , but I built myself right back up and again , continued to just fight through it worked section by section and at the end of the day , the audit was completed on time and they had no findings at all . So I was very proud of myself .","So this is a situation I am very familiar with . Uh , my organization is commonly known for being rather reactive than proactive . Uh , so there are plenty of situations where um , decisions need to be made very quickly . Um , and at sometimes , I mean it's , you don't have all the information in front of you . Uh , you have misleading information . Sometimes you have conflicting information . So , um , this is pretty common for me for what I deal with on a day to day basis . Uh , one situation I can describe is , so I do a lot of the budgeting and the forecasting for um , the company overall . And so what we have to do , we have to sit down and go through all , you know , our list of okay , here's everything that we're planning , um , for this month , for this year , for this quarter , um , and sit down with the respective parties and just make sure that we are still on the same page . Are we actually going to spend this much ? Is there anything new that has come about that maybe we didn't initially plan for at the beginning of the year ? Um , and a lot of times when I'm going through , Uh , this , this situation in this scenario , um , there are some information that pops up that , you know , it , it conflicts . One person thinks that we need to buy this many machines and then another person says , Oh , no , absolutely not . We have enough , um , capability and , and enough open capacity , uh , to be able to complete it . You know , what we have . So then once you run into a situation like that , you kind of have to sit down , review everything with both parties and actually do some analysis and figure out , okay , do we actually have the space ? Because that would obviously be a cost savings . Um , overall , but in general , this is something I deal with , uh , pretty frequently .","So the first thing that comes to mind here is , uh , when I initially started , um , at my company and when I started , uh , in my current role , so I have a wonderful boss , um , who w I mean , he's great to work for , but the one thing that he always wants to do is he wants to challenge you . So I remember walking in and , you know , not knowing too much about the system , not know , I've definitely not knowing much about the processes as far as what we make and what our company does in general . Um , so rather than him giving me all of the answers and just , you know , he would challenge me and he would say , no , you know what , try and figure it out . Do what you can , you know , get the answers in ways that you think you would succeed . And at first , that really stressed me out . That really , that kind of scared me . I was like , okay , I don't know anything about this place . Um , I don't know even where to start . Um , but as he continued to challenge me yet guide me in a way , um , I started to realize and see for myself that , wow , okay , I'm growing . I can answer these questions on my own . Um , I can find the answers without having to rely on someone just giving me the answers , um , themselves . So that was probably my first really high pressure situation when I was there , um , because I didn't know what I was walking into and it is a very fast paced , um , you know , quick decision making company . Um , that I initially didn't feel I was prepared for . But I took , um , proper steps . I got to know people in different departments . I got information , I got an idea of who to go to , um , for certain aspects of the job . Um , I got myself out on the floor to learn more about the processes and the procedures and to watch how the machines run , how things are made . Um , so yeah , overall I , it was just , it , it was challenging but very rewarding at the end . Um , I believe the type walk out of the doors most days , and I would just feel such a sense of accomplishment and that was just a great feeling .","So , uh , one specific situation that comes to mind , uh , was in the quoting aspect of things . So a lot of the things that I do , um , deal with working on quotes for our customers , um , and customers , uh , just like anywhere can be , um , very demanding as far as a stringent timeline that they anticipate that they're going to get the information back in . Um , so what I did , uh , I was working on one quote , I just started and um , next thing you know , I have a , uh , another quote that comes through at around the same time , but this one is super , super hot , you know , and takes priority over absolutely everything . Even the direction that my boss gave me , said , Nope , this one we've got to get done first . And the other quote that I was initially working on , I had promised the customer I would have that quote to them in their hands , um , by a certain date and time . Um , so once I received the second request , I was pretty stressed out about that . I was wondering , I'm like , okay , how am I going to , Oh , how am I going to juggle these two ? Right ? I made a commitment , a promise to one customer , but now this other one comes through and it's extremely hot and you know , if it's coming from my boss and it's gotta take priority , obviously , um , that one has to be pushed ahead . So what I did in this specific situation was , um , I did take the priority quote and continued to work on that one first . Um , however , in my downtime at home , um , I did actually go above and beyond and I finished the other quote in my free time , um , at home and just so that I could , uh , you know , I could , um , achieve what the customer had wanted . So at the end of the day , I managed to get both of the quotes done , both in an acceptable timeline that the customers were anticipating . So , um , it was some long days , but , uh , I was , yeah , I mean , sometimes you just gotta do what you have to do to get the job done .",3.666666667,3.5,2.666666667,3,3.333333333
45,P577xsa-9uruan,"Hi there . In my current job as a project manager , one of my main responsibilities is scheduling the staff . Um , in a recent time at our company , we've had major changes to the processes in which scheduling is offered . Um , because it's complex and changing . Um , it's really important for me to stay on top of the technology that we're using and also be able to train , um , the staff that I'm scheduling with on how I want them to use it so we can effectively plan their schedules . Although it has been a little bit of a challenge , um , teaching folks how to use the new software and to get everybody on the same page . It's been really rewarding because we've seen a lot of results with , um , just the change in process and change in system . And I really think it's beneficial for everybody overall . Thank you .","So referring to the previous project of getting all of the staff on board with the new processes and systems for our scheduling . Um , it was actually , um , partly me and the rest of our team that was responsible for , um , even getting this new , um , process and system set up . So over the last year we had been working towards our various goals of number one , getting the buy-in of management in order to bring on , um , some more efficient processes and systems in order to do our scheduling . Uh , secondly , um , after , um , we were able to get the buy in of management , it was important that we were able to get together all of the financials of what it would cost , um , for the project as long as well as the project schedule . Um , so that was our second large goal . Um , and our third large goal was the testing process in order to make sure that , you know , this was going to be the right process for us and that it was going to work with some of our existing systems . Um , and our fourth goal was , um , while it is currently training and , um , getting all of the employees on board with the new system and , um , working in our new , uh , new and improved scheduling processes .","Oftentimes with the role of scheduling staff , um , I can be faced with this predicament . Um , sometimes really the decision might involve , um , scheduling one employee to a shift because , uh , another employee hasn't gotten back to me in a timely manner . Um , oftentimes when we do have to make these quick decisions , um , you know , there are , there is feedback that it's not necessarily , um , in the best interest of the employee , but we do have to , uh , remind them that , um , you know , the process is , is in place for the reasons , um , it is in place so that it follows our policies and our guidelines in regard to the scheduling . And if employees aren't able to get back to us in a timely manner with their schedule , then we do have to go ahead and just schedule those shifts . So sometimes that can be a really difficult decision . Um , but it's really important that we keep things moving . Um , because we are a very busy department and it's very important that our projects are fulfilled .","So I currently work full time and have a , um , um , some classes that I'm taking at university and I find that drain exam time , it can get very stressful . It can be really difficult to cope and , um , you know , I really do need to , um , prioritize what I need at that time in order to make sure I'm successful . So in these areas , I really try and keep my schedule as clear as possible . Um , I give myself extra time for self care , even though I'm , you know , it seems counterproductive to still get those workouts in and you know , to still , uh , get that eight hours of sleep . I know that for me it's really important that I work , um , you know , to be successful and not work myself to exhaustion . And so when I am dealing with conflicting schedules and , you know , just don't seem to have any time on my hands , I always make sure that I do at least allow for some time in order to , um , make sure that I can cover all of my commitments and still be healthy .","So my sister recently graduated from RCMP Depot training and I was invited to attend her graduation ceremony , which was such a big deal for our family . And , um , unfortunately I did have to work that day . Um , you know , I understood that my workload didn't really leave the possibility for me to take the time off . And due to the pandemic , we weren't really able , um , to plan ahead of time because we didn't know whether or not , um , this ceremony would be happening . So when we found out last minute that it would be happening and that I wouldn't be able to attend due to my workload , um , you know , I was able to arrange for , um , my lunch hour to actually be at the same time as the ceremony and I was able to participate virtually . So , yeah , it wasn't the same as being there in person , but I was still being able to attend virtually and get all of my responsibilities done at work that day . So I'm super glad that , um , my workplace was flexible and that we were able to make it happen with the magic of the internet . Thank you .",3.666666667,2.5,2.666666667,2.666666667,3.333333333
46,Ph87d83-3uwwvv,"At my work , we have complex environments because we're audited by the government to make sure that we're filling all the quotas that they required by staffing numbers , inventory , customer complaints , and praises , as well as any extra miscellaneous things that apply to the work environment . It's complex because they will monitor our files , make sure everything's in order to make sure everything's dated side , and there's a lot of paperwork involved . I take pride in the fact that in the complex environment , they know that everything's in order and once they get there , rather than being a week long process or a few day process , they're able to finish after one or two days and then they're able to supervise their staff and look at them and ask them questions , make sure everything's in order . So that's something that I believe that I'm able to adapt well to because it is on a random basis and you know that it's coming once a quarter , but you never know exactly when . And you have to be able to be prepared for that at any moment at the drop of a pin . Essentially .","The company . There's the Prairie divisions that kind of bounces the whole Prairie division and one project that I'd like to make sure that it's completed and it's somewhat hard to achieve is when we have a module or an ROP assessment we call it , we need to have , make sure that 95% of our base has taken it within a three to four week period in there . Otherwise the managers lose our bonuses . So this is something that I really strive to achieve very quickly . Usually within a four day business that accounts for the two day weekends that someone may have or three days they call in sick or have an extra vacation day . And I can always achieve that 95% and it's a bit of a push because you sometimes it can take up to an hour to complete some of the modules or training sessions , especially when they send down a training specialist to make sure that everything's done in order . But I take pride in the fact that even though it is hard to achieve , and it kind of reduces the staff and other areas , but at the end of the day , they're learning new things and it's very encouraging to see the smiles on their faces .","In my workplace . We have a restricted area and a non restricted area within the restricted area . You must always wear a face mask . Recently one of my employees reported to me that a agent of one of the different companies within the worksite came into the restricted area without a mask on and he was waiting for his manager who was on the restricted area to bring a mask for him . My employee was also screening other people and it was getting to be a bit of a queue . While they waited for this mask , he asked the employee of the other company to leave the area and come back , but the employee refused saying his manager would be there soon . He didn't want to go through the hassle of everything again , so he would rather wait . My employer offered him another chance , waited a little bit , and then took away his past access to restricted area . Basically disallowing him from entering their strictured area again without an auditing situation done through the whole airport . This is conflicting information because we have my employee and then we have the manager of the other employee plus the employee , and they all had different variations of the story that the manager giving an explanation why it took them so long to get there . Why the other employee for God has masked , and we've been wearing masks for two years , and then my employee , who though a bit of a stickler , is able to explain the reasons he did , and because I was able to make the important decision quickly , I backed him up because he's my employee and I treat him with respect . Making sure that the final decision that rested with me was one that keeps everybody secure . So the man lost his pass for the day . It was reinstated the next day and the next day he traveled . He came , he came through the screening area . He had a mascot .","So as I'm applying for the project manager position , I also wanted to say that we've had a bit of a vacancy in the leadership division of our company . We've lost two checkpoint managers , quality weed and now this project manager position . To top that off , our operations manager has been off for the past five days because he's Russian nationality and there's a big situation going on over there , so that's left to checkpoint managers to run the whole situation and it's become fairly high pressure because there's two of us and we have to be there for 24 hours a day essentially . So it's putting 12 hour days between two people , zero days off . What we did was analyze the situation in tandem with the operations manager and how we responded was that we contacted another site and we were able to get one of theirs checkpoint managers to come down to our site . So it's going to take another day or two . This is really going to alleviate that pressure or stress that we're facing . It's 12 hour days . When you wake up at three get off at three , wake up at three to get off at three you can get pretty tired and you kind of run dry . You don't want to run your batteries out . However , I believe that the outcome of the event will be that by having three we'll be able to rotate to better shifts , eight hours , eight hours , eight hours for the next while until things clear up a little bit . Market .","One of our employees at work recently pulled a rip and they've been going to physiotherapy and they've come up with a solution with the physiotherapists in order to rehabilitate themselves the best way possible . However , the demands of the rehabilitation are very hard to achieve because she needs 30 minutes of activity and then 30 minutes of rest sitting down activity on her feet , 30 minutes sitting down . So we try to make the commitment , but it's very hard to be able to continue with throughout for an eight hour period . So for this specific situation , she has brought forward some complaints because on occasion it has been broken out , it was short staffed or people are taking breaks or there's just too busy . It's not that we have downtime all the time , so while I am , she experiences these difficulties , I do try to talk with her about it and we have come up with another work plan . Essentially we're brought it down to 15 minutes at some point , but we try to make sure within that hour she's able to get a half an hour . Sometimes it's just not in the 30 minutes that she would like . If it does go over , sometimes we're very extended .

47,P9ezfsu-di7srh,"Um , so in my current role at my organization , um , I wasn't involved in basic implementation of accounting system . So in the process of , um , uh , implementation of that accounting system , I had to be sickly break down all the steps as a project manager to basically make sure that the project is , uh , implemented successfully . Um , so as , uh , as the first step , it was to understand the requirements . So I had to understand the requirements for the accounting system for the business unit . Also , my limitation of some of the risk of some of the , uh , every , uh , you know , I w I would to have more work on it , understand the resources , and then based on that , I had to schedule basically , uh , implementation plan . I had to design the implementation plan , I had to get engaged . Uh , various teams involve like it fight , so talk to make sure that we are all on the same page , understand their limitations and requirements . And , uh , for example , one of these liquidity requirement was , uh , you know , the process has to be implemented at some point prior to year end . And also I had to take into consideration , uh , some of the finance team responsibilities and , uh , you know , because our implementation shouldn't have been , uh , interfere in the , uh , you know , day to day process and , uh , you know , the , the normal , uh , operations . Um , so the , the product was successfully implemented , uh , uh , you know , uh , we had some challenges at the middle of the project are sometimes at the end of the project , but because I had the executive team on board so I could get the additional resources to make sure that of the project is meeting its timeline . So I was able to communicate that effectively to the executive team . Uh , you know , the requirements , the challenges , and , you know , I was lucky to get , uh , the , the support . So I was able to earn the trust and , uh , we could implement , uh , the projects on time .","So , in my previous example , uh , basically meeting the deadline for the implementation of that accounting system was pretty hard to achieve . Uh , first because there were so many dependencies and second that it has , it had to be implemented at a certain point of time because of , uh , you know , annual , uh , uh , free financial reporting cycle . You know , we couldn't really jeopardize missing the deadline . Um , so in order to basically , uh , achieve that result , achieve that goal , I had to monitor the progress of the project constantly . And if I realized that any point , you know , we are missing the deadline for , uh , for any reason , I had to make sure to eliminate those challenges and those , uh , uh , roadblocks , uh , you know , that could be , uh , you know , uh , engaging external vendors or , you know , bringing up the issue to the attention of the executive team , getting additional resources , getting additional , uh , help or the support or making certain changes into existing process . So these are all basically , uh , um , you know , these were all helping me , uh , to achieve the result . I think the main , main contributor of that was , uh , being able to communicate , uh , and being able to foresee all the roadblocks and obstacles ahead of time and being able to manage them properly in order to executive execute the project on time , on budget , basically well , physically , because the timeline was really important . So , uh , I had to request additional budget , which was basically understanding for the executive team because I had the proper justification and no one wanted , you know , to jug to productize the executive execution of the project . Uh , you know , timeline or deadline .","Again , in the same example , you know , uh , well unfortunately the main problem was that some of the individuals we were dealing with because of , uh , the , the type of industry we're working on , we were dealing with so many legacy practices or regulations that , you know , the individuals who are running the process were not aware of that . That was the main challenge , that obstacle . And uh , you know , understanding how those legacies and regulations are playing into the process , the current process and how it should be implemented and transfer it into the new system was a , was a significant , a significant task . So I have to understand , uh , you know , all the steps I had to take . I had to understand , you know , all the different processes , how they going to play a role into our , uh , how , uh , in the new system , how they should be implemented in the new system . Um , this was key . Uh , the some point , you know , because our new system was accommodating certain things . So , uh , first , you know , at some point when I was dealing with the situation that I had to , um , think about if , uh , this , what system can accommodate is acceptable by the business , by the industry . I had to get it , get involved like external consultant because , uh , you know , when there is a legacy and , uh , you want to make , to change it until August . See , you know , it's just really a risk . So no one , uh , accept the risks . So I had to get an external consultant involved and , you know , because I wanted to have the input to be able to justify to change into the going forward process . You know , these was , uh , some of the stuff , some of the time that I went out to make a quick decisions and , you know , I was , uh , I was receiving conflicting information about the same topic .","Well as a project management manager , you know , dealing with the stress and working under pressure is , uh , just constantly part of the job . So , uh , especially when you have certain deadlines that came out really negotiate a bit like that adds into the pressure . Um , I explained to before that , you know , in order to meet the deadline and uh , you know , overcome those pressure , I had two months constantly monitor the progress of the project . I had to make sure we are working toward our goals and to what our deadlines . We are able to accomplish the project and task on time . Uh , you know , if there was any road block , I had to foresee that and I had to basically , uh , mitigate that . All of these were helping me to , uh , manage them , uh , reduce the stress . But stress is always there . You know , sometimes , uh , you know , certainly things are not happening in the way that you're expecting that could significantly impact your success . The success of the project and these sorts of things could happen at the last minute . So , uh , you know , I had to , uh , make the decision of them quickly . Uh , you know , by getting engaged a executive team or , you know , asking external consoles . And so I had to remove all those roadblocks and they had to remove all those obstacles , uh , to , to reduce the stress and the pressure . And I think I've done a pretty good job , you know , uh , over time I've built up the trust and a build off the conduct of a personality to , uh , you know , manage myself , manage my stress , and also be being able to think under pressure , the number of threats , which is really key and important .",". So , um , I had the situation in the past . Um , so , uh , you see , not , not in the project that we had that , uh , you know , we had a tight deadline , but in other projects , you know , when they were not with the wing , they didn't have that much of a priority . So when this situation was happening bowl , you know , what it was doing , I was trying to communicate , uh , that I wasn't able to , um , meet the deadline or the requirements add of time rather than creating surprise for my immediate manager or my executive team . So I was explaining to them , you know , the situation , you know , the priority teams sometimes , you know , what works best for me was asking them to prioritize the task . You know , when I realized that my resource is limited , that I'm not able to meet all the deadlines . So I would ask them to prioritize the task and what should be completed , what should be done . Uh , rather than me making a decisions and putting myself in a situation that , you know , decide which task to be completed or reached out , should it be , um , do you know what that worked really well for me ? And , you know , most of the time , um , I could get some , uh , understanding from the , basically , you know , my boss and my executive team , uh , which helped me a lot to prepare for your types of tests and boring , and also manage the resources in a way to meet the deadline more efficiently and , uh , you know , making a realistic commitment .",3,3.333333333,3,2.666666667,3

Um , transcription is not actually a simple job . Um , in addition to just obviously listening to audio and transcribing it , you have to be able to , you know , do things like discern accents . You have to know a lot of technical terminology because on a marketplace like rev , um , you get basically a different subject every time you pick up an audio file , one may be legal , the next one may be medical . And you have to be able to transcribe all of that efficiently enough , uh , for it to be actually worth your time as a job . So what I did is I went out to every basically blog , YouTube channel , whatever I could find , um , hunted down all the resources I could on basically how to be a good transcriptionist . I went through all of that . I found resources on things like , uh , commonly used text expanders . Uh , text expanders are basically when you shorten a string of , like commonly used words in a transcription to something very small . So you're just hitting a few keys and then you have an entire , um , phrase there for you . Um , they're very important to transcribing efficiently , you know , quickly enough for it to be worth it . Um , but it's not something that you get a resource on with someone like rev . So basically I went out and taught myself all of those things , found all of those resources so that I could be the best transcriptionist I could for this job where , uh , you know , the subject matter was constantly changing and things like that .","So in addition to the work that I do on a day to day basis , which at this point is mostly freelance content writing . Um , I'm actually a published novelist and the first novel that I got published was also the first novel length work that I had ever written . Um , I had never taken on a project that ambitious before . Um , and at the time I really had no concept of how to go about doing it , like actually accomplishing that goal . Um , so what I had to do was really , I got involved with a number of communities that were kind of built around that . Um , I found a lot of resources on how to plot out longer projects like that because up to this point I had been writing for a long time . I just hadn't had to deal with something with a plot that was that long and that had to be thought out that well in advance if you don't just want to come up with a complete mess of a novel . So I found a lot of plotting resources , um , a lot of things about like how to do spreadsheets around all the different scenes that you're going to have . And then I just set out , before I ever even got to like the writing process , I plotted out everything that I could possibly need . I had all the character information that I needed to come up with . Um , I did a lot of very intense development ahead of time so that then the actual writing process could be successful . Uh , and it didn't turn out very well that way , even though it was the first novel length , um , work that I had written . I had it written within a month , the first draft , um , edited , edited a few times after that , submitted it . And it actually got accepted to the first publishing company that I sent it to , which is not a typical first publishing experience . Um , and then later got nominated for a Lambda literary award . So , you know , having taken all of that preparation in advance really did turn out well for me with that project in the longterm .","I used to be a manager at a sushi shop when I was a little bit younger back in my twenties . I'm 34 now , so several years ago . Um , and obviously I was responsible for overseeing the day to day operations of the sushi shop . I was the manager there , uh , which also involved managing our workers . And for the most part I never had any serious problems with our workers . But there were instances where we had largely , it was clashes of personality , but even just clashes of personality can get very heated . Anyone , anyone who has had to manage that before will know how that can go . I had one instance in particular , it was during the summer , we already had kind of tensions high there , um , because we on and off had no air conditioning , which isn't great at a sushi shop . You basically can't operate then because all the sushi gets warm . So we've been going through some drama around that already . And I just had it where two of my workers who they weren't hugely in opposition , but you know , they didn't get along most days and everything just came to a head between them at once . And I actually walked into the kitchen like to a shouting match between these two workers . Um , and I had to pull them apart and figure out very quickly , first of all what had happened because some of the accusations they were throwing back and forth at each other were actually fairly serious . Like it would have been grounds for firing if I had just immediately listened to one over the other and gone , you're out of here . Um , but I had to pull them apart , calm them down , um , because I wasn't going to get , you know , rational talk out of them at that point and then pick that apart to figure out , you know , is this accusation that's being thrown around , which is serious actually true . Or is this just to people who have had enough of the situation with like our air conditioning had enough with each other and are basically throwing whatever they can at each other because they're angry right now . And it did turn out to be one of those situations instead of one where I had to immediately fire someone . But if I hadn't taken that time to pull them apart and sort everything out , like I could have unjustly fired one of my workers and that obviously would have been a bad situation .","Another job that I had back in my twenties , um , before I got into transcription and then content writing work , which is what I do now . Uh , I was actually working at an assisted living home . I worked there for five years . Um , so a pretty significant amount of time for a job like that . And there's a lot of situations that will come up there in a , in a place like that where it's like very high pressure , very stressful and you have to react immediately without losing your head . Um , you are responsible for people who are at their end of life . Most of our , you know , residents were in their eighties and nineties , some even over a hundred . And obviously when you get up to that age , there's a lot of health complications that can come with that . Um , I mean we had things like heart attacks , um , people who died in their sleep . But one of the big risks with people that age that I don't think a lot of people realize is it becomes very difficult for a lot of residents to swallow food and water . Um , liquids are actually considered a huge problem with choking at that age even . Um , so we would have scary situations that would happen in the dining hall just occasionally . Um , it wasn't all the time , but I would say once every couple of months something like this would come up . And I remember one incident in particular , I worked in the kitchen , so I was usually closest to the dining hall . Um , and I heard a woman choking , uh , and people shouting for help and I just booked it out of the kitchen . I ran straight to that table and I started performing the Heimlich maneuver . Like you can't lose your head in a situation like that . Someone is immediately depending on you to save their life . Like you have to keep your shit together and there's just no choice or else you can't work a job like that . Uh , so I got straight to her table . I , I did perform the Heimlich maneuver on her and we were able to get like the food that was obstructing her airway back out again , you know , and she survived , which is the outcome you definitely want in a situation like that . Um , but having worked that job with dealing with high pressure and stressful situations like that pretty routinely , uh , has made it much , much easier for me to deal with , you know , stressful , high pressure situations and other jobs . Because more often than not , no one's life is depending on me making the right choice . And after , you know , having that in your hands , everything else has kind of small potatoes .","When I got my , um , first kind of serious real world job , I was transitioning into being a content writer at the time , kind of switching over from like the restaurant assisted living home , that kind of work that I'd done before . Um , it was a job that came with a lot of overtime . Um , and like it just happened that sometimes we would be under a crunch . We would need people to stay late . Um , and there wouldn't really be a way of getting out of it without also having to be like , and I quit my job , uh , which obviously I didn't want to do . But at the same time I had a commitment with a , um , volunteer group . It was actually a nonprofit in Denton that worked with abused children basically . Um , I ran one of the rooms , um , that they would kind of bring kids into . Uh , well first they brought them into this place . There were several different rooms we would take them to because a lot of these kids also came in with absolutely nothing , like maybe the clothes on their back and that was it . Um , and we'd be responsible for getting them like , you know , more clothes so that they could change out of the one set that they currently have . Um , I worked in the room that did clothes . I also , um , gave the kids Teddy bears or stuffed animals . We had this like whole wall of them , um , that we'd walk the kids up to and be like , you know , pick out whatever stuffed animal you feel like would be most comforting essentially . Um , but because I was working that job at the same time , I would have those , you know , sudden over time things come up and you know , I would have a shift also scheduled with that volunteer organization and the two would conflict . I couldn't really leave work , but I also couldn't leave that position on manned . Um , you know , with those kids that we were bringing in . Um , so what we had at the time with that volunteer organization was basically a phone tree . Um , you know , they had a phone list with pretty much every volunteers , uh , you know , number , contact information on it . And when a situation like that would come up , like I have overtime , I can't get in , like on breaks , I would just sneak away and call everyone on that phone list that I could get in touch with until I found someone who could take over my shift . Um , because again , that wasn't something I could leave on manned . And it's my responsibility to be able to fill that role with someone else who can come in and then lead those kids through that .",3.666666667,3,3.333333333,4.333333333,3.333333333
50,P3v4r59-bz3tnv,"Well in my work life , I've had to deal with quite a few , you know , changing or complex environments at work . I think a lot of us had to deal with , um , these types of things in 20 , 20 , 20 , 21 , 2022 . Um , so when early 2020 , I was working at an office in quite a touristy area and this job required a lot of um , you know , meeting with clients , meeting with coworkers , meeting with people in general . And it also included going to , uh , very busy areas like hotels and tourist areas . Um , so once the pandemic really started , um , we were working in the office I think for another week or two and then , uh , we all had to work , started working from home , which kind of drove through it all our plans , all our meetings , all our work basically . Um , and me being one of the younger people on the staff , we basically had a coach , our managers and a lot of the older staff on how to actually use technology to work , use zoom , use Skype , how to start meetings , how to communicate . Um , so I feel like during that time I really took on the role as leader , and I think we did it pretty successfully actually .","Well , one time I was working for a company that was based overseas . Um , the branch was in my country , but um , it company was originally founded overseas . So we had to create a presentation , um , basically on the future of the company or the , and the future of that season . But the CEO was coming from overseas and um , I had to , the CEO wanted the presentation to be in his mother language , which working for the company , I could kind of pick up some things here and there , but I definitely was not fluent or possibly probably even conversational . So I just put in the work , um , to , you know , took it on myself , took the initiative to really , instead of backing off or getting scared or sorta saying I don't want to do this . I took the initiative and I really prepared , studied meticulous everything I was going to say . He tried , I knew everything , all the definitions , all the translations . Um , and I had about two weeks to prepare and just a lot of hard work and dedication to really , even though it's a really difficult situation and it was a really hard goal to achieve , I feel like I did really well compared to , you know , some of my other coworkers . So I feel like I really achieved my goal through hard work .","Well , this situation happens quite often in my field of work . Um , where I would get in one area , I would get , um , a certain type of information and in another side of the company I would get totally different information and I'd basically have to choose . Um , one that happened recently was I was doing field work , um , and my field supervisor was giving me some numbers and some data about a certain type of material , which I thought was correct , but I would , when I went back to the office , uh , I was talking to my other supervisor , um , and he was giving me totally conflicting information , um , totally different data , totally different numbers . Um , so at that point I wasn't really sure which one to use . Um , and in that case , I , you know , instead of , instead of just kind of guessing or just throwing my hands up and giving up , I got into a meeting with all three of them or with all three of us . Um , I decided that it was best to really communicate and , um , explain the situation , explain what's going on and try to figure out , get to the heart of the matter where we are actually going wrong and why there's different data . Um , instead of just passing it on to the next person's problem , next person to worry about . Um , and that communication , that straightforward , and it's really helped to alleviate the situation . Um , I got all the right data . Um , and hopefully the next person won't have to go through that again . Um , so yeah , it really worked out in my favor .","Well , I had a really stressful situation . Must've been ninth grade , um , middle of the second semester . Um , I had to go out of town for two weeks , um , for some important situation that had really didn't have anything to do with school , but , um , it's something that I had to do . So I had to miss two weeks of classes in the middle of the semester . Um , and I knew that was really going to mess with my , um , ability to complete reports , complete any homework , um , attend lectures . So I made a deal beforehand . I kind of like saw it as coming , maybe deal forehand with my , uh , one of my classmates and I would basically photocopy all their notes they took in class , um , summarizing the lectures . So I would at least have my idea of where we were in the syllabus . Um , what we were doing . And of course when I did get back , even with those notes , um , it was really tough to complete , you know , two weeks worth of homework and , um , projects in right away . So I basically , I talked to all my teachers , explain the situation . Um , and they were gracious enough to give me , extend the deadlines a bit . Um , so it still wasn't not easy to complete them . Like I didn't have so much time that I could Slack off , but I had enough time where it was possible they were spaced out . I had a couple of days do this , a couple of days to do this and just hard work . And I eventually caught up , um , maybe a week or two later . Uh , and yeah , just being straightforward and being , um , honest about your situation .","Well , as I said earlier , um , to have a lot of experience working , it's like a point of contact for customers or clients working directly with clients . Um , and me and my clients usually get along really well and usually have no problems . Um , there's even this client where , you know , we committed , we'd , um , set a schedule every Tuesday to go for lunch . Um , and this is our chance to really kind of connect outside of work outside of our two companies , um , and really help build the social aspect of our work relationship . Um , but during this time , our project manager , um , Okay , It was on vacation , um , this week and I basically was basically stepped up into the role , um , which , which did give me a good experience as project manager . But , um , it was definitely , it was definitely , um , an experience I was learning . Um , and that that Tuesday we were really busy . Um , so I wasn't able to , um , you know , keep our schedule of going out every Tuesday for lunch . Um , just base base , uh , based on the priorities . I'd be scared to weigh the priorities , which one is more important . And yeah , that Tuesday was , um , there's a lot of stuff going on . Um , and they , they understood . Um , we actually ended up going out the following week on Tuesday and Thursday , so we still had that , you know , we had that needed social outside of work connection with our , even though it was a work relationship , um , and the client understood and everything turned out well .",3,3.75,2.666666667,2.666666667,2.666666667
51,Pawmcrq-7fxmzt,"During the beginning of the pandemic , I had to adapt to a rapidly changing work environment . Unfortunately , there were a lot of layoffs . I was fortunate enough not to be laid off . Um , but , but this meant essentially , um , taking it , taking up the roles of people who were laid off . So all of a sudden , um , not only did I have to complete , continue to complete my own workload successfully , I also had to account for the work of others and actually take care of their work . Um , this was quite overwhelming . It was a lot on my plate . Um , in order to actually successfully complete everything I needed to complete . Um , what I really did was plan out each and every hour of my day . Um , this was really the main thing that allowed me to juggle so many different roles , um , even roles that I wasn't necessarily familiar with at that time . Um , I really just researched roles that I might not have been familiar with and then just took a planner and scheduled everything out . Um , like I said , hour by hour .","I am the social media and marketing manager at my company . Um , and part of my role is to participate in giveaways . So recently , um , my company partnered with another brand to do a giveaway , um , with the goal of growing our email lists by 10,000 new email contacts . Unfortunately , right when we started , um , when the giveaway was launched , I immediately noticed that we were really not on track of reaching the school . We did not have anywhere near as many signups as we thought we would in the beginning . Um , which through analysis really just didn't look good for us . Um , this immediately concerned me . Um , and I realized that we needed to do something quick if we still wanted to reach our goal of 10,000 new email subscribers . Um , what I really did was assess the situation , um , took a look at our graphics that we were being used that were being used , um , and really just did a complete revamp of these graphics with permission of the other company that we were working with . Along with this , along with just visual visual changes , I also implemented different verbiage , um , in order to maybe better attract people people's attention to participate in this giveaway . We also very slightly tweaked the giveaway giveaway rules while honoring people who had already entered . Um , but we added a , another element , um , an optional element that would promote our giveaway actually being shared and exposed to a larger audience . Um , one other , the final element that we did was actually putting some ad spend into the giveaway . Um , we originally weren't canning on doing this , but we decided that this ad spend would be worth it given that we could accumulate 10,000 new email contacts . Um , through these actions , we were able to luckily meet and exceed our goal by the end of the two weeks , which is the length of the giveaway . Um , how long it was running for .","Recently at work , I needed to quickly , um , make the switch from one email provider that we are using for email marketing to another . Um , this needed to be done really quickly because we were a contract essentially was up with the original email provider . Um , something we didn't unfortunately realized till the last minute and we needed to switch over quickly . But before we were charged , um , an egregious amount by the original provider , um , while making the decision , we did consult multiple people to see which email , which new email provider would best suit the business . Um , unfortunately we heard so many different opinions , um , in terms of our guests , so many different answers . So there were so many different answers people provided in terms of which provider to use . Um , and this really just left us feeling like we were back or it left me feeling like I was back at square one since I was ultimately in charge of making the final decision . Um , in order to fully determine the decision , I decided that instead of continue continuing to get feedback from others in our network , um , I would do some better research and also go through , um , potential email providers and ask them for demos . So what I did was , um , uh , dived in , um , did some more in depth research , came up with my own list of top potential providers . Um , and this was a list of three . And then I contacted each provider and asked for a demo . Um , this helped me narrow down to one specific provider , um , who we did make the switch to .","When I was obtaining my undergraduate degree , I had to take a series of organic chemistry classes as part of my degree requirement . This was definitely the most high pressure situation I faced in any of my education thus far , just because organic chemistry was extremely difficult for me . Um , in each and every one of those classes I really struggled . It was so hard for me to grasp fully , um , and understand all of the concepts . Um , really each at the beginning of each class I really faced high stress . Um , so at the beginning of series a for or plus a for example , I was really stressed class B . It was very stressed , classy , it was very stressed . Um , but for the beginning of each situation , what I really did was , um , find out which were the best peer tutors in the course , um , who completely , who successfully completed the course the best , um , or who , who was sorry , who is , who is the most knowledgeable , um , in this course and was available for tutoring . Um , based on that , I would ask that person if I could join their peer groups for studying . And , um , I really just tried my hardest to study as much as I could with that person who had already , um , completed this class successfully and who was open and dedicated to helping other students complete the course as well . Um , this really was very helpful , um , along with each student who did well in that specific class with a specific professor . Um , along with just asking them to help me work through problems , I really also asked them in specific their own study approaches and try to learn each for each course . What study approach really worked for other students . This really helped me successfully complete each of this . Each class .","I recently committed to being there for my mother for an important event that she was helped helping host this event that meant a lot to her .

I told her on the day of this event I would be there to do it . Um , unfortunately , during , as this event , I've got closer , um , my workload itself skyrocketed . Um , and became much heavier . I found myself time or tied down to a lot of work commitments , um , or projects I should say that really required full , full effort and attention and that I couldn't just set aside .

52,P6bzpfq-8qmxx4,"One project that comes to mind is , um , a major project that we're working on . It was a two year long project and in the middle of this particular project , our company purchased a new office building and they were relocating , um , my whole team to different buildings . We usually have , uh , certain meetings that are scheduled each day so that we can provide updates to the customers so that we can have updates from the onsite engineers on site . Engineers will tell us , you know , what was happening in real time . And then we also had regular team meetings that were taking place at the same time . So , um , this was really an opportune time to have to pack up and move our offices . Uh , but we had to do it . And so I ended up having to put a schedule together of when each member from our team was going to need to be in the office to pack up . Uh , and we scheduled our meetings around the times that we were given . And then we also needed to know what day they were actually going to have to spend unpacking once they got to the new location . Um , with those people in mind , I was able to set up before Kobe , um , video conferences where we were able to have people logging in even if they were , say in their car or at their house , um , during the time that we meet them to meet . And it took a little planning . It was very tricky sometimes , uh , but we were able to get through that particular of being without any major delays or problems . Um , and then I also set up a , a place online where people could upload their documents that had the updates as well . So they MBB something happened and we couldn't reach them . We still had access to , uh , the latest status report and we were able to keep the project moving without any major delays .","So back when we were preparing for a Y two K there was a bit concern that , um , because of the way that software had been programmed to track the year , uh , in our dates and all the computers who used Microsoft office or a particular operating systems like , um , angulate and the Googles and um , windows that once we went to the year 2000 , it was going to throw everything off . Um , this private problem was something that everybody kind of knew about , but they kept stalling and stalling , installing , uh , on when we started the project , we ended up one year before having to go into our telecommunication system specifically to update the timing so that it wouldn't , um , throw us back to , you know , zero , zero , literally zero , zero , zero , zero . Um , and you had to go through every piece of software that we had . We had one year to go through every piece of software that we had . It was very time consuming . Uh , we had to bring people on to our development team and teach them very quickly how to go through the coding , what to look for . And then we had to test and test and test . Uh , we were not sure that we were going to make it in time . And so when 1999 at midnight , uh , occurred , everybody was on call , uh , physically present at work and waiting for the time to shift to 1201 . So that we could see if anything was broken . Uh , we were able to get it done . We had a few small , uh , problems , but because we were all there and we were already , uh , we were able to resolve those rates quickly . Uh , it was a very tense situation , uh , because customers do not , like when their phones are not available . And , uh , we pushed through and we got it done .","One of the jobs of my team , um , is to work with the customer on their requirements for features that they want to , uh , roll out to their customers . And we always try to pick a regular date , like once a month , um , on a Friday night or a Sunday night when we think that there will be a little bit less traffic so that if we , uh , install the updates but we run into any problems , it will impact the least number of people as possible . So we had a situation where there was a new feature that the customer wanted immediately . Um , and we had that , that update , but it included other updates for other customers as well . We went in on a Friday night to do the installation and everything was working well for the customer who wanted the immediate update . But one of the features from the other updates that have been included was knocking the system down in certain regions . Our customers are all across the United States . And so we had one part of the region who seemed to be fine , no problems . And then we had other parts of the reason that for some reason their voicemail message services were not working properly . They were not able to access their voicemail . And so we talked to uh , the onsite team and they were telling us that they didn't see any problems , but we had representatives from our customers who were calling us to say , no , our customers are calling us and telling them that they cannot access their voicemails . And then we had another set of representatives from customers in a different part of the country who were telling us that they could access the voicemails but they could not hear them . So we were getting a lot of conflicting information . I had to make the decision as to whether or not we would try to fix what was going on in real time or whether we would go ahead and remove the latest date knowing that the customer who wanted the update would be very upset . Um , it was a hard decision , but the decision was we were losing so many customers just overall we had to pull it back . I was able to work with our own site team to leave the code for the update to the customer , and the customer was very happy , but we had to remove everything else and that's what happened .","One thing that will always forever stick in my mind is my senior year in college as a computer science major , before you can graduate , you must complete a senior project , uh , where you design an entire system of your own . And I chose to do a checking , a time checking system that would allow employees to enter their time sheets into the system and it would calculate , um , all the things that to go on your check , how much your money was and had the growth of putting out subscription and could provide a bunch of reports that would allow the manager to be able to say who was working , when , how many hours , uh , at what pay . And it would be a more efficient way to attract resources for projects so that when we decided what the buckets were , we could go back and look at the various projects from before and do a very good estimate . The night before the project was due , there was a thunderous thunderstorm in our city and it not be electricity completely out . So many people panic because the rule for senior project was no excuses . Your stuff was due by 8:00 AM on that last day . If it was not beer in the teacher's hands , you would feel the course . It wasn't , it wasn't a , um , a B , C type thing . It was a path or a fail and people were scrambling so hard . I was fully prepared . I had backups of everything I had worked on . Uh , at the last day , the only thing I was doing was putting in , you know , a few tweaks , making it look prettier , that kind of thing . I was able to take my backup copies , go to a different lab and finish everything on time . Some of the cute stuff that I had added but didn't have time to put that in but didn't matter as long as I got it in by 8:00 AM . That was stressful . Um , people service so many people who were just sitting in the hallway crying , they were so upset , they didn't have a backup or their backup for like from the very beginning . And they have made a lot of changes , um , between the time that they did their backups in the time that they were ready turned their projects . And I am very thankful that I had a mentor who always told me back up and hard copies . You need to keep them at all times because things happen and you want to be prepared .","And the lead project manager , there were three of us and because we wanted to keep things fair , uh , everyone had spent some time , uh , as the on call representative and we had a pager that the customers would use back in the day . We had a pager that the customers could use to let us know if they needed to speak with us because there was a problem . Uh , whoever had the pager had to respond . So my aunt and uncle were getting married and I was committed to be there to help decorate before the wedding to help me . Sure . The food and things were in place for the reception . Uh , and it happened to be the weekend that I was on call and I gave them the heads up . I let them know like , Hey guys , I'm on , I'm on call this weekend , so I'm gonna try my best to be here for the entire event . But it's a possibility that I might have to leave . And so just as they were preparing the Fe , I do , the pager went off and I had called and see what was going on at work . There was an outage where one of our , uh , cell towers had been damaged and needed to have someone go out to repair it as soon as possible . I had to leave the wedding , um , and go into the office so that I could get the , the people , uh , the right people in place . We could get the actual equipment . The equipment was not in the same state as the customer . So we had to get the equipment , get packed up , get it shipped there and then make sure that the proper B we're there to pick it up , unbox it , install it properly and give things up . And we had about a six hour window to do all of this . Uh , I was able to do what I needed to do , get things going for work . Uh , but then I had to really apologize to my uncle , uh , permission out . I , you know , I tried to keep my commitment . I kind of planned things in such a way that there aren't any conflicts , but that particular time had to take the , um , priority and I was able to do it and get things back . And luckily I had given them a really , really nice gift . And so they were , they were okay with it . Uh , also they ended up having , uh , another kind of get together for the family a couple of weeks later where I was able to go , I wasn't on call . And then I got a chance to kind of enjoy the videos that they had from the reception and other things that happened .",4,2.5,3.333333333,4,3.333333333
53,P452tmy-93gijr,"A time that I had to adapt to a changing and complex environment . It would be about two years ago when the pandemic started them out of my workplace . It was primarily working in an office setting , face to face . Many people would be face to face without considering the possibility of remote jobs or working from home . I think the complex environment that was changing was that fact that that was not possible with social distancing and other initiatives recommended by the CDC or any institution . Uh , it's um , specializing in medicine and healthcare . I think primarily that it was very difficult for me to adjust to having to work at home , but not only working at home , burping , managing my other coworkers , employees that I supervise that are also working at home . I think this is something that's inherently different than managing them in person . You can definitely see them , how they work , how they act , um , if they're feeling , um , overwhelmed , um , stress , that sort of thing . I think even offering feedback is a lot more personal in person . I think that was something that , um , was a negative for me having to work at home . And having to interact with them , add them through zoom or do any , um , online means , um , to adapt to this . I effectively had to get more accustomed to the sort of new technology I needed to become more proficient in it and see what kind of technology I have available that I can use to , um , check with my workers , talked with them , converse with them . So I feel that I'm actually providing him necessary feedback , advice . So it doesn't feel that it's too rigid too they , and not enough to actually help them complete their work , complete their assignments on time . I think that this was something that I took steps to do . But beyond that , I think what I initially have to adapt to just sort of a new setup is basically get to , um , not only use the technology to its fullest , but also , um , consider the fact that there's going to be some setbacks and some inefficiencies , some things that aren't exactly quite the same , but I should still try it anyways in that , in that sense , I still implemented the technologies , try new ones , see which ones work better , which ones that were actually more effective and more necessary for my needs . I think this is something that I did over the extent of that year and India , and I think I went into at that , well , I think my employees are motivated to still do their work . Um , I think they were also being helped as , as I could . Um , it was definitely comparable to , if I were to do it in person or at the office .","A time when I set goals for our project , would it be about , um , I think four years ago it was a project that I believed my team could accomplish in about six months . Um , normally the projects that we implement take more longer about a year and even more than a year . Sometimes . I think we really , I believe that I couldn't have accomplished in six months a lot shorter given the many of the actual information and data necessary for the project was already obtained . I think the resources were also already there . I think it wouldn't take minimal steps to actually implement and then the project could be finished easily in six months . I think in general that it's not quite what happened , that there was a lot more delays , a lot more time spent on certain aspects of the project . That definitely made it feel like we were strapped for time and that it wasn't going to be quite feasible , that the project would be finished in six months and that it was likely going to be finished in a longer time , more comparable to the original , um , um , average for project time , which is about 12 months as I mentioned . But in order to actually make sure everything was on track , I still met up with my employees . I made sure that to keep track of the progress , um , adapt to any challenges , um , offer Felix a buddy , that sort of thing . So if there was someone circling , I would ask , um , if anyone else could help , I would have asked for my help as well , see of if there was any way we can actually speed up the process . Um , so we wouldn't delay any further and the end , I think it was definitely a bit over than I planned . It was about two months , additional time for the six months , um , goal that I had . Although it was definitely a bit of a struggle at times . I think that's definitely helped that show that this was more feasible than I thought that such projects could be implemented and completed a lot faster than the average project time , and that I think this helped me identify what we can do better for next for a future project , so I can have a better estimate of how long it could take and a better estimate or what kind of work or how time is allocated for the work group .","Situation where I needed to make an important decision quickly . It was during a new product that was being implemented , but that required a new program , software , a program , a software analysis that would collect and analyze data . I think at this point our previous software that we were using wasn't effective . It was , um , I would say outdated and that we needed to quickly decide upon a new one , a , a more modern programs implementing use that would not only be something that gets the job done but could also be easily learned by the coworkers . Um , any other employee that desires it . I had to basically research and decide a program that would fit these sort of criteria and uh , I would hope that would actually be able to produce data that without errors or some sort of issue that would delay the project or just take a lot of troubleshooting . Um , in that sense , I was getting a lot of recommendations , information from not only my employees or coworkers and even , um , sources on , I was looking online , uh , which programs were the most optimal for our intended use . I felt that it was a lot of information to take in . There was a lot of recommended programs and that I couldn't exactly pinpoint the most optimal one right off the bat or in a quick manner . Despite that I still needed to , um , actually pick one before . Um , I've given time , which was steadily coming up and that , no , I think I was definitely , um , considering comparing the information , seeing which one , what was the pros and cons of each ? Um , software ? Um , each program . Um , not only that , getting advice from others to see , um , based on their , um , their input , their ideas on how they would be able to implement the programs . I was getting a better grasp of which offer would be the most intuitive and the most user friendly . So that would avoid errors while also still being able to accomplish what our task ultimate outcome was that I decided upon a program that I think fit the criteria well . I think it was very appealing . I think there would be minimal difficulties . I think it was even comparable to our , to the old program while still offering new new features on a better optimization . So it would be a lot quicker and more accurate . The actual outcome of using the program , I think many of the employees liked it better than the old program and software . I think they found it easier to use , and in general , I think there was a lot less errors and mistakes being made from that software in comparison to the older software .","It time I had to cope with a high pressure or stressful situation at work in school . Um , specifically it wasn't work . It was , um , assignments in some tasks that I needed to complete , but that also relied on my work group to actually have their work done , their , um , input done so I can actually finish it up and make sure that the task in this assignment was actually done . The issue was not when , not only that the deadline was coming upcoming , but also that some of my employees were delayed on the , on their part of the assignment . This was primarily due because they had not only conflicting , um , issues or demands from their personal life , but also that one of them got severely sick . I think this was definitely something that I didn't expect , didn't anticipate and that it definitely gave me pressure to actually , um , considered that the possibility that that assignment wouldn't be completed on time . It was necessary that , that this employee was unhealthy to ask you a complaint . But I believe there was , um , also , um , necessarily that they needed to recover from this , that they , as they stood , they wouldn't be able to complete the task . They're part of the test . Um , on time I responded , um , I had to consider the fact that as , this was definitely a challenge that came out and that I needed to resolve it , I needed to actually take on these responsibilities , these as this part of the assignment and work on it . I definitely took a bit longer than I normally would do on my own part as hours I did additionally at my workplace . So I normally , um , had to do , um , work over time and , um , I needed to believe that this was just a temporary thing , that this wasn't something I would do often , but this was something I needed to do . So the assignment would be done on time . I think the overall outcome was that not only the assignment was done , I think everyone , um , that wasn't , um , uh , contributed , was able to do work that was , that was good . That it was definitely optimal . And despite the challenge that everything resolved itself at the end .","At time . I experienced difficulty keeping a commitment at work though two conflicting priorities that were also important would be when a coworker was asking , had asked me prior to um , this , these conflict of commitment occurring to um , give them feedback to give them advice in terms of their work . Um , and also about in regards to their career . I agree to initially because I considered that there would be time in the future , but the time we agreed on upon and ended up being a time where I actually had to also complete some other priorities at work specifically I needed to meet up with some , some other workers at a meeting . This meeting was a lot more important considering that I was describing changes in the schedule , that it's describing some new procedures and policies that I will not only have to attend the meeting to learn about the set policies , but also ask questions or even become better informed so I can explain these policies and procedures to others so they can understand what's being changed and understand why it's these policies that are being transmitted , implemented . Naturally . I realized that I wouldn't be able to delay the meeting or even skip out on the meeting , that the more likely situation would be that I would have to postpone the feedback and the meetup with the employee that I'm with the coworker , that I would offer him advice and also , um , other information about their career and their career goals , that sort of thing . I specifically told them that in person I didn't do it through email or through some other means . Online means I needed to to tell them that this was something I definitely regretted , that I did not consider the possibility that there would be other things I had to do at that date that were more pressing and that I needed to actually attend to . And that I understand if they wish to , um , um , to seek some advice from others . But in the end they are , they were very accepting or understanding of the situation affecting me in that area to postpone it to another date . And even beyond that , I think we've met . I managed to also meet up with them in the future to talk to them more regularly , more frequently , but I also kept a better track of my schedule to make sure that I didn't meet up with them on a day that I had conflicting priorities so I can better manage my time and my obligations at work .",4,3,3.333333333,3.333333333,2.666666667
54,P2hsrrx-823bax,"Well , the only constant thing is change , I believe . So there's always changes that come and arise and I am a very flexible individual . I'm able to adapt to things very quickly , especially I'm expected things . I'm in one situation for example , we had policy out and we had to go by procedures step-by-step cause we usually do standard work with that . But then the following day it actually changed . So those changes began to become implemented a day later after that notification of the change . So immediately I was able to assist in providing project AIDS , job AIDS to my team and to realign with what the agency was expecting as a whole . Likewise in project management I would do the same thing . Um , maybe it's more related to a deadline or maybe I'm having some barriers with getting to the next step of our project . So being able to realign and do things . Um , so that way we could still be productive but also be able to manage that change . Sometimes for the benefit of the doubt . And I would also be organized in the sense of , yes , we have a , the spine , the foundation of , with deadlines and everything . But then , um , also being a flexible when things don't go your way .","So there is one situation where , um , I had set goals to complete metrics for a project and that was due at the end of fry at the end of the week on Friday . So what I did was because I had other things happening that were not under my control , I actually was able to utilize my resources and um , the AIDS as well as part of my team to help me gather those things so that way I could be ready with , um , within the deadline and timeframe . Um , I also adjusted so sometimes that requires me adjusting what the priorities are . So if I'm working on one project , but then I have a deadline for another one that actually got boosted up , then those priorities switch . I stopped that first priority and switched to the second stint , the deadline up , for example . Um , I utilize a lot of my organizational tools such as tools and trackers and things to be able to learn me for things . That is how I was able to achieve my outcome is by utilizing others and asking for help . I think that is extremely important to ask for help when you need it . Um , not only does it show that you're just like your colleagues , but also that you're not perfect and I don't think someone , even a project manager should portray that perfection , so to speak . I think the vulnerability actually helps with being held more accountable and more genuine and trustworthy .","So add a team member who is asking to move some members off of their caseload . And um , I also needed to provide the receiving unit with these cases that were supposed to be transferred . But I had a team member who was not willing to transfer them based off of location and all though . So what ended up happening was I had to talk to my supervisor and see how we could collaborate or make this work . Um , and in the end what ended up happening was that my boss ended up saying , Nope , we're not going to do this . This person needs to give these cases to um , to transfer . But then hours later , hours later , um , because of a situation with this team member who didn't really listen , we ended up , I ended up making that decision of no , they're not going to transfer . Um , just because it doesn't meet our policy . And also cause I was also looking out for the team as a whole . It wouldn't really be fair to accommodate for one and not the other who was in a similar situation . So , um , moments later , meaning hours later , I ended up getting an email saying , hold that thought , make this request in a couple months . So what I ended up doing is I still have that conversation with that individual after discussing with my supervisor and coworkers , um , supervisor level as well , the transferring supervisor , so to speak . And , um , I had to make the decision of Saying , you can keep these people , but because you're keeping these people who are still going to be receiving people , so your caseload might be a little bit higher . And that's just because of the need of the , of the agency . And , uh , with regards to a longterm request , I had her perspective on that for another couple months until I got more finalized . More for sure answers .","There was a time where at around 4:45 PM , we were given a , the supervisors were given an email , um , with a return time for all of the results or metrics to be turned in , uh , close of business the next day , which is only 24 hours now based off of the work experience that I have in the field that I work in , um , it's very much social services and work . So my unit isn't always available because they're out on the field , um , doing assessments for , for , for members . And so getting these metrics would require me to actually have to communicate with them and some of them wouldn't be available . So what I ended up doing was I copied a lot of the information that was given to me . I put it in an email and I made sure to inform my team that I understood that the timeframe was a short turnaround . But if they could then , if they could please fill it out to fill it out and send it back to me . Well , it turns out the outcome of that was a mix . Actually . I was able to get more than half of my team to respond in that 24 hour timeframe , pretty much letting them know , like I understand this is a short turnaround . I greatly appreciate it if we can . If you can't , that's fine . I understand . Just let me know . I'm very big about open communication . Well , it turns out because of that open communication and me being really honest with them and me knowing that there was a short , short turnaround and acknowledging that it allowed me to , um , actually gain more feedback and more , more responses from my team . So I got more than half of my team to respond , which was amazing . And I definitely think them after and acknowledged them as the next meeting .","So I was recently invited to participate in a three month long work pilot program for a project for the division and the agency . And what ended up happening was , um , I had actually talked with my supervisor about it because I know I'm a person that although I love doing work pilot programs and putting my input on things because of the position I was in with all of the changes and things and important priorities I had , um , I needed to run it by her to make sure that I wasn't giving too much of myself and exhausting myself . Um , so what I ended up doing was I actually learned how to say no and , and that's what I did for this time . But I did express that I was still interested for the future . Now , in other situations about keeping a commitment , it kind of varies on the situation . So for example , if my commitment is that I'm going to come into the office and be in person and be available for my team , then yes , I'm going to be in the office . Um , the only thing that's gonna make me not be in the office is if I'm sick or if an extenuating circumstance happens . Otherwise I am there . Um , if I have a difficult time keeping that commitment , I try to be as open and honest as possible and I try to find an alternative so I can still be there and do the things I do need to do . Um , that is as close as I can to the commitment and keep that commitment . So it's being there to support . Um , the team member was showing them a strategy on something . Maybe instead of being there in person , I could be there in a video chat and I can maybe share my screen and show them the process . Similarly , as a project manager , I would be doing the same thing .",3,2.25,3.333333333,4,3.666666667
55,Phzeafi-57auy6,"Working in an academic healthcare institution . Um , I feel like it's rather , uh , possible , unlikely , um , that I encounter a , a changing or complex environment at work . Uh , so when we had some staffing changes and we had other business managers that left the organization , um , I was asked to step in and cover , um , those departments that that business manager had previously covered and then that ended up becoming a full time coverage situation . So it effectively doubled the number of departments that I was responsible for . So obviously that was a big adaptation . I had to , uh , work with , um , a new set of managers , but continue to meet the needs of my managers as well . Um , so to adapt to that , I met with the managers and tried to , uh , understand any of their concerns and be able to respond to that . And especially with the new team that I was supporting , I wanted to make sure that they felt heard as well and that they weren't going to feel like they were lacking support . And I feel like the outcome was pretty well balanced . I think ultimately the hospital had to realize that they were stretching . The business manager's a little too thin . Um , but overall , um , we made it work for the short term .","In the , um , labor and delivery floor that I work on , uh , in the postpartum unit , there are , uh , infant hearing screenings that are conducted . And at the time we were working with a local organization that was no longer able to provide that service . So the project I took on was to price out what it would be for our hospital to provide that service in house and the equipment and the staff time that would need to go towards that . Um , and then compared that to partnering with a new organization who could come in and conduct hearing screenings and we would just contract with them to provide that service . Uh , so I compared a cost benefit analysis for that and was able to share that with senior leadership to ultimately come to the conclusion that , um , D expertise and the risks of , um , there being any citations or errors , uh , was better when working with people who specialized in the infant hearing screenings .","As time allowed , I like to do a bit more of a deeper dive into the financials for the various departments and maybe just pick like a sub account for the month where I dig in a little more and kind of tease out some of the expenses that I'm seeing that I don't have a good understanding of . Um , you know , what is behind that expense . So at one point I found that we were paying for some offsite storage , um , and it wasn't clear like who had authorized that situation , why that situation had started in the first place . But , um , we were looking at what costs we could cut . So I assured senior leadership that yes , we could definitely get rid of this offsite storage . Um , and so I had to make that commitment quickly because of the time crunch , uh , situation we were in and I didn't have all the information yet , but I was determined to dig into the situation . Um , and it took some , uh , like I had to partner with , um , our financial services , uh , department so they could help pull the invoices and stuff that were behind that . So I could contact the company , uh , get an understanding from their end , what would need to be done to terminate the service and get those files brought back onsite to the hospital . And it took some time to dig into that to see what we had to do to officially cancel that and get things moved over . But they ultimately were moved over to the hospital and we stopped paying that ongoing monthly service fee .","This is another situation where just working in a hospital , in an academic hospital , a high pressure and stressful situations are very common . Um , so for instance , uh , when the coven situation was kind of first emerging as an issue , um , there were a lot of , uh , just ad hoc meetings and constantly changing , um , ways of , of how we were going to handle things , how we were tracking expenses , uh , just how we were reorganizing departments , um , like areas of the hospital we might need to kind of shut down for quarantining purposes . Um , it , it was a lot . Uh , so I think it was just such an evolving situation that we were all just trying to go day by day and figure out what made the most sense . And , um , I mean ultimately we came up with a strong system that enabled us to ensure like adequate tracking of expenditures and like staff time that was going towards treating COBIT patients . Um , and it , it's obviously like still something that we're currently monitoring . Uh , but we have a pretty firm process in place at this point .","I'm generally pretty good at . If I , if I make a commitment , I intend to follow through on it . Um , so I think it's generally just giving myself some grace in letting things kind of naturally fall to the side if there are things that are priority because I don't feel like my managers , um , are really that particular about things . They , they kind of have a lot going on in their own units that they're not overly concerned if they get a financial report on the seventh of the month versus the 15th of the month . Um , so I think the main difficulty for me is just allowing myself that grace and especially in the annual budget cycle , um , a lot of the day to day things kind of just needed to be pushed aside and I need to kind of reprioritize things so I can make sure that the budget stuff gets done . But not too many of the day to day stuff ends up getting pushed aside cause we still need obviously the critical things to get done .",3,2.5,3.5,2.666666667,1.666666667
56,P5tq66a-b2xjf5,"At work , I've had to adapt multiple times to changes . Uh , the place I've worked has changed contracts a couple of times , meaning that we've dropped services to one area , adding services to another , which causes major changes that basically we get a little bit of prep time for . And then one day it just switches off or switches on . So what I've always done is tried to keep up on any announcements of the change , anything I can do to prep in terms of learning the new customer or learning the new field or area . Um , and also in the same sense when dropping an area , learning though what they rely on us for and that , uh , is unique to them . So we know that we will no longer need to offer that and can move our time and resources away from that .","With all the issues caused by coven . Uh , the last two years have been nothing but hard , uh , times in terms of reaching goals . I've set goals for projects that have had issues with getting materials , um , between shipping delays and company shutting down and correction shutting down . It's caused tremendous , uh , lead time extensions . And even in some cases , points where a year in we haven't been able to get the product . And so what has happened in those is I've had to either look at an alternate part , an alternate solution , alternate software , that kind of thing . Uh , some projects , what had to happen as we actually had to narrow that part of the project out and say that this would be forthcoming later or in , uh , the most drastic , had to completely rewrite the project in a way that , uh , could work with what was available . Uh , it was a project involving cameras . There was no way to get cameras out of Japan . And so we had to basically redeploy hammers we had with a different backend , uh , which of course costs some more money . Uh , but then once the cameras are available , they'll be able to be plugged in . So right now , the cameras are deployed in the way they need to be , however , they are a lower quality because they're the older camera . So the customer is happy , um , to a point , uh , knowing that there's a next step coming , but they are not exactly satisfied with what they have at this point .","In the realm of dealing with a project , conflicting information is pretty common . The biggest problem comes up that almost always there's some grain of truth to the , the information given and then an either an embellishment and exaggeration or just a misunderstanding . And so the biggest thing you have to do is sort out what is real , what is not real , what is opinion ? What is fact ? Um , that has happened to me before in a project when , uh , we were working with a new software vendor and listening to different users that were given demos and time to work with , uh , uh , demonstration software and people saying there are things that it couldn't do . People saying it could do things and knowing that certain things that they were saying it couldn't do , it could just from the simple fact that the product was purchased for that reason . I'm realizing that some of the things I said it could do were misunderstandings and having to discard those . And uh , basically doing that on the fly . Um , the entire time span we had for this was less than a week . And so the biggest way of dealing with that was to ask questions back when possible . Um , or just knowing what the vendor said and having to take that as as truth . Um , just striking those incorrect pieces of information from the , uh , information coming in . And so ultimately what happened was we went back to the vendor , so we needed some slight changes in the product . They were able to do that with some plugins . And then we had a , uh , another piece of software to show and train and then actually deploy .","Right now I'm working on finishing up a masters in school and a stressful , a very high pressure situation that came up was involving , uh , writing my thesis . Uh , I started thesis work at the start of the semester in January , uh , with the expectation that I would be finished in may . However , there was nothing that showed on the syllabus that basically starting in January I needed to be done in March to present . And then once that presentation was made , they needed April and may to finish , uh , making determination on it . Uh , so basically I had about 36 hours or so to decide am I going to try to push through and get done by March , um , and not maybe have the best product or should I push my graduation back to the end of the summer semester , which would be in August to give myself a little bit more time to make a better final thesis . And so what I did is , uh , for , for that 36 hour period , uh , there was a whole lot of , uh , fixating on that and making the decision . Uh , I had to look at costs . Luckily with the way that this works because it's just the thesis I'm doing . There was no difference in price . Uh , once I started the class , it only is listed for a semester , but it's considered to be until the work is done . And , uh , with that in mind , I decided I'd rather make the better product overall . I've only got one chance at it . Uh , once this thesis has done , that's the last time it's dealt with . And so I chose to push back .","Luckily for me , this doesn't happen all that often . Uh , I'm usually able to meet all the demands from , uh , different directions within the department . Uh , however , where it has become an issue is when there are large scale rollouts or other big events occurring all at once . And what I've had to do in those situations is look at the priorities of first my own department , since that's who I work for . But then also , uh , the organization as a whole and way , which is more important , uh , which ultimately will do the best overall . And in some ways what I can get away with . Uh , I ultimately do have to report to my manager the end if she's not happy with it , uh , that's always going to be create a problem . However , if I can go to her and explain to her why maybe her priority isn't the best thing to focus on at this moment , uh , then get her buy in to change my priority for that period of time . In the same vein , when the person that comes to me is from outside the department , I may have to go to them and say , look , uh , for right now , this has to be pushed off a week or two a month , whatever , because I have to focus on this main part , uh , within my department directly . Uh , usually that , uh , isn't always greener with the utmost excitement . However , usually after a good full discussion on it , uh , people understand the reasoning and are pretty , uh , open to , uh , allow a shift in priorities . Uh , the only pushback I've ever gotten is when I've tried to push something back a couple of weeks and they really want it faster than that . And then basically the whole cycle starts over . Um , ultimately in those , by the end , uh , everybody is at least placated . They may not be super excited , but , uh , they're satisfied with the work done and that overall , the organization will benefit .",3.666666667,2.333333333,2.5,2.333333333,3

Um , so recently I had to do how to use new tools , how to do things in different ways , and I'll in that , but also be open to looking for new things and finding things to do in different ways . And what I found is once you could get very comfortable with the way things work , um , there's always better ways to do things . And so I took it on as a challenge and I find it very exciting to be in such a dynamic .","So one of the hardest goals that I set was last year we'd be did a training for Salesforce administration example , and everyone in our division , which is a lot of people participated in this training . And I really wanted to pass the administration exam and be a certified Salesforce at mystery as it was really difficult because in addition to all my normal job duties , which I had , I was also every evening putting together a study guide , reviewing it , taking practice tests , spending a lot of time on this . Um , and so it was a lot of extra work , a lot of out of the ups work , but it did end up paying off . I , um , after all that study , all of that work , I was able to take the exam , I was able to pass it and I was one of just a handful of people in my division who were able to do that . So it really gave me a lot of new opportunities as well .","So a lot of times I'm the project manager . It's up to me to make the ultimate decision on which way the project would go . One of these was a pessary that we administered to first year students here at our private university . Um , there are a lot of different opinions from different sources on what should be included in that poll survey , how many questions , how much was too many or too little . Um , and ultimately it came down to me right at the end to make a decision . Um , my , my style is that I try to take all the information that I can so that it was one as I possibly can be . And then I trust my own thinking process and multiple process to make a decision . So I ended up making one that kind of took into account all of these things . There's a happy medium and I felt like the project turned out wrong . People were genuinely satisfied .","I recently earned my master's of public administration degree , which was really a great experience , but obviously it was a very rigorous curriculum . It took a lot of extra time outside of work because there's an executive program , I feel to get all the projects done , one of American , particularly a statistical project I had to do for a stats class . Um , it was very , very rigorous , very detailed on , we were given just the raw material Apache to come up with a comprehensive report . And I was kind of looked at as the expert on how to use this statistical software . Um , it was a really , really stressful week . Um , but I usually find that I do all my breaking the project into smaller steps . Um , I give myself breaks that night night could be really , and I trust my intuition . Um , and everything turned out to be .","So at work , I balance and juggle several responsibilities and I enjoy that . I thrive on that , but I also have to understand my limits . Um , and I remember one time in particular after I passed the Salesforce administration exam , I was asked to sit on a Salesforce community that was me for a couple of hours a day . It was to give a lot on . Then I realized that my other areas of work were separate because I was devoting so much time and mental energy to this one project . Um , and I try to be cognizant of that . So I sat down with my supervisor . I explained how I was feeling . I can't put this gesture and I said , would it be okay if maybe I didn't attend this committee or cut out some of these meetings ? And together he had some suggestions too . And together we were able to work it out so that I could cut back on some other projects and then I could still do my best in the projects . I was still .",3.666666667,2,3,2.333333333,2.666666667
58,Pj44mhz-axaekj,"Hi , I am currently working on a project , it's a project manager and have had to adapt a lot to changing situations and a lot of challenges . So I'll , I'll describe a few of those now . Um , where I'm hosting with an organization , a conference that , um , the attendees are both tech savvy and then also people who really don't use technology and aren't adept with the zooms . So I've had to create tools to help people , um , access the conference . So this includes hosting a zoom help room , um , written instructions , outreach via email , providing phone number , um , just providing various avenues to help connect people with the amazing content we're presenting at our conference . So , um , so far , I mean for the very first session there were a handful of people that could not connect and we followed up with them . I followed up with them to make sure that they had access to the conference recordings and took steps to really try to avoid repeat mistakes from happening as far as connection issues . And it's , it worked because we had two additional sessions today and there were no out , like people reaching out for help . So I think people are used to the interface now , and our event has a really beautiful and interactive flow and we're getting lots of positive response time , um , responses actually from people , which is fantastic .","I'll continue to talk about the project and currently managing , um , which is , uh , gardening conference in the city where I live . Um , and in attracts a really diverse group of people who are enthusiastic about gardening and the environment . Um , so this , this conference usually is an in person event , but because of the pandemic and the uncertainty about new variants popping up , we decided to host it virtually again this year . Normally it's an event where we have a lunch , people can hug each other and it's , it's just a wonderful way for , for people who are avid gardeners to connect and , um , it's really difficult to , to create that virtually . But through having a , um , online platform , we were able to create areas where people can , can connect via the chat or video . And , um , the feedback we've received is that people feel happy about being able to at least connect with others from across the city , um , uh , in a way that they wouldn't be able to normally . Um , so people are very grateful for that .","As a communications manager for an organization , um , that links gardeners around a large city . I am often tasked with having to vet information before we share it out on our website and social media channels . So I'm in one particular situation and it's actually a topic that's still hotly contested to this day . There is an organization who , um , they are creating , um , um , biosolid I guess it's called a material that is compost that is suitable for gardens that is comprised of composting human waste at a very high temperature . So it kills pathogens and , um , other things that might remain in the and the source material . And obviously this is a very , um , controversial topic to many people and there's still a lot of , um , unknowns out there . So I've been really hesitant to share the information until we have a very solid list of pros and cons that support or don't support this as an option for people looking for sources for compost . So we've held off really promoting it , um , and hope to have some really clear , clear directives about its , its use in community gardens .","The situation I'll describe is the same project that I'm managing at the moment . I'm a virtual conference . And the stressful situation that happened is that right before the conference began we realized that every session we were , um , preparing for was being live streamed into the lobby of our conference , the virtual lobby . So , you know , doing the tests with the presenters , um , to make sure their screen share was working or their audio is working was all being streamed out to the people who were present in our conference lobby . And we're not talking about a lot of people , but it was quite embarrassing because that was not the intention whatsoever . And the platform we were using did not allow us to turn that function off . So it was extremely frustrating . And so what I decided to do was post a message in the event chat saying that you may see us prepping , it's your special look behind the scenes and tries to make light of it . And I mean , this is a conference with , with people in gardening and urban agriculture . So it's not super , um , high pressure by any means . People are usually pretty , pretty kind and forgiving . So , um , nothing really happened other than we , we've made a point of making people aware that we were aware that we were visible before the sessions began . Um , so that was kind of embarrassing , but seems to not really be having a bad effect on our conference .","Over the course of the past couple of years , the situation of having two shifts , timelines and directives and projects has come up . I can't tell you how many times . Um , I feel that the overall , the most effective thing to do is to have extremely clear communication with clients and create a zone that's very comfortable for them to be able to pivot and reorganize and shift , uh , projects , deliverables . And I try to be very accommodating at the same time , managing , you know , retaining the ability to manage my schedule and my own team of people . So I , I can't think of a specific event where I had a hard time keeping a commitment I made , but I frequently do an assessment on a weekly if not daily basis of what I need to prioritize . And then I , I make shifts and if I have a , a very serious conflict in my schedule , I reach out to the client and I see if we can , we can shift our timeline slightly and 95% of the time clients are very accommodating . Um , so I , I can't really share a specific situation because usually I actively work to prevent , prevent any huge issues .",3.666666667,2.333333333,3,2.333333333,3
59,Pd6qauh-9a7hj4,"So I work at a , um , animal hospital currently and , um , we recently , um , hired a new doctor , um , who really doesn't , um , you know , effectively work with the team , um , has as well as the other two doctors currently do . Um , and , and it really had to take a lot of steps to sort of accommodate their needs as well as , um , provide exactly their specific , um , intentions for what they need as , as , as adopter . Um , this is very important to , to cater your skills to a particular doctor as they have their particular needs and their particular way of doing things . Um , so the most important thing is , um , communication at a personal level , um , as well as interpersonal , um , you know , a team membership level basically . So you really need your whole team to be on the same page with that one person . Um , and that's really important , especially when you're hiring somebody who's basically you're your boss , um , but also , um , somebody who you're working with all the time as well as , um , providing guidance because at the end of the day , you've been there longer than them , you know , more than them in that particular role . Um , but they , they more , they know more than you . Um , overall they know more than you , um , in a , in a base level as well as a professional level , um , from everything to , um , knowledge about the subject as well as , um , you know , the particular skills and guidance that they can provide and the , um , the advice that they can give as opposed to you who's just sort of a technician . Um , so really I focused on providing , um , clarity on what they need as a , you know , as a , as an individual person . Um , and then reiterating that to my team , um , privately and in person , um , are in , um , you know , in public . So I really just sort of focused on their particular reasons on catered to their needs based on , um , you know , how we work as a structure , as we work as an organization . Um , and again , that's really important for me to , to , to both fit in with this particular person as well as have this person fit in with our team in general . Um , whether or not that's my decision to , to hire this person or to use this person as , um , you know , source of , um , knowledge or source of information .","So one particular project I can think of off the top of my head was a , um , working , I was , I was , uh , volunteering for a nonprofit organization , which is a harm reduction organization based on reducing , um , you know , uh , problematic , uh , substance use and um , behaviors in the rave night lift community . And so one , one huge project we had was to , um , sort of rebuild , um , the organization stone by stone and , and , and structure by structure to , um , fit the sort of modern needs of , of uh , raves and nightlifes . And so really , I , I work with my team and the people , um , around the country to start basis there again , um , and start a basically chapter in each sort of city , um , and then , uh , communicate with them every single day or every single week or whatever fit their particular needs , um , what they need as a individual , what they need as a team leader , and then what they need as a chapter . Um , so again , communication is super important for me . I really emphasize on communications . That's the biggest thing was communicating what they needed , what I needed . Um , as a , as a , as a , as a , as a national organization and then as a individual , um , you know , membership and then to the sort of individual , um , chapter leadership point , you know , at that particular moment in time .","So I work at a , uh , animal hospital and I monitor surgery . Um , so there are very often literally life and death moments with , um , particular animals or you know , when an animal goes under . Um , and very often I'm the one that picks up on this as somebody that monitors the surgery . The doctor doesn't really typically do that . Um , and so actually the , this , this one particular time that I can think of , um , the , the patient was , um , we intubated the patient and he started turning blue . Um , and I know that I told , I told the doctor that pretty much immediately , but , but he sort of shrugged it off and said , no , it's it , you know , you're kind of imagining things and , and that , that's not the case . Um , but I really stuck to my , my gut instinct . Um , the patient did end up flat-lining , which we immediately had to abort surgery and immediately start performing CPR . Um , and I just , I just knew that was going to happen . I told the doctor that the patient was not stable . Um , and he , he told me otherwise . So I really , you know , uh , doubted myself . But had to make that snap position to , to say , no , I am right and the doctor is wrong . Um , which is tough at moments , but important to understand that there are moments in which , you know , more than , than somebody who's trained in the position for 30 or 40 years . Um , based on chronologist situation , your particular knowledge of the patient , you a particular knowledge of , of the situation and the monitors and , um , you know , tools we use to monitor patients in general . So that was one time that I had to stick to my guts and , and understand that I knew better . Um , and doctor didn't , unfortunately , um , the patient did survive . However , um , it was learning experience for both , uh , my doctor and me .","So , as I , as I said , I work at a , um , animal hospital and very often people on call out there was a , uh , a day about , uh , two months ago in which three out of the six people that work there , um , called out of the job . And so I was by myself upfront on a really busy three Dr. Day as well as providing assistance for the kennel . So I really have to switch my brain back and forth very often in order to , um , you know , stabilize myself as a person and , and , and understand each particular situation , each particular case , each particular call . So there was a lot of sort of brain switching going back and forth in terms of what I needed to do . And then again , um , sort of continuing that to its end stage , whether that's checking the client out , finishing the phone call , um , finishing , um , you know , what I'm doing with that particular patient at any moment . Um , but you really have to do sort of flip flop your brain in , in any different direction , whether that's talking to , um , an older client on the phone . And then immediately I'm going to hold a 180 pound dog with all your might . And then again , going back to talking to somebody who may be a difficult client on the phone or , um , somebody who's really nice , you know , so you really have to do flip flop your brain . And then you also have to remember , um , you know , individual people . Um , so you're , you're answering calls as well as knowing the dogs and knowing the people at the same time , knowing the cats , knowing the people same time . So you really have to balance everything . But at the end of the day , perform your best and perform every task to the end because that's super important that you finish everything you start because there's just nobody to sort of fix that or nobody to , um , provide any insight into , um , what cracks you mess or , um , how , how you slipped by without , without , um , providing assistance to one particular need of a , of a patient or a client . Um , and , and all that . All that's important . Equally important .","So , um , I do like to volunteer , um , in my free time . I typically volunteer at , um , lbs and shelters , um , and , um , animal rescues well at the same time working a full time job . Um , this particular moment was when I was working two full time animal , um , veterinary technician positions as well as trying to volunteer at , at the shelter that I , um , had volunteered at for a long time . And I did feel like I had a lot of , um , you know , uh , sort of sunk cost into this , um , uh , rescue or shelter as I had sort of , um , helped them for a long time before getting either of these positions . Um , but I really did have to juggle a 65 to 70 hour work week with helping help assist people that , that , that meant a lot to me and , and honestly , um , them meaning a lot to me , meaning lots to them . Um , so I really did have to , to , to juggle a bunch , but also , um , step back a little bit because I , you know , flat out told them I unfortunately I can't help as much as I as I normally would because I'm , you know , taking on , you know , double full time jobs as well as trying to help the best I can . I'm in a little bit of a better position with them now . Um , as I , um , did quit one full time job , um , but extended my hours for another , so I'm nearly at the same amount of hours , um , as I was then . But I was able , I am able to have a more flexible or slightly more flexible schedule in order for me to help with , um , volunteering at this particular animal shelter . Um , and I'm still on really good terms with them , which is great and it makes me really happy that I'm able to , to help with them as well as , um , do my daily , uh , full time job .",3.333333333,3,3.333333333,3,2.333333333
60,Px52aib-hi94xu,"At my current job , uh , not too long ago , we got a new president and this new president like to do things way differently than the previous president . Um , so we had to adapt the way we did things . We had to change the way we did things . Um , but I that did some research to find the best ways to go about doing it . I then asked my supervisors and then asked my fellow employees and even some of my subordinates what their thoughts were , and we all kind of got together and came up with a best plan . Um , once we did that , we implemented it , ran it by the president , and he was super happy with what we had decided to do . Uh , I felt good about how we went about it . He was impressed by how we did it . And I'm , I'm happy with the outcome .","Uh , not too long ago , uh , my company took over a big report that we had previously paid a consultant to do . Um , we , it wasn't something we'd ever done before , but I felt confident , you know , seeing the previous report that I could , could replicate it and add stuff to it . So when it came time to do it myself , uh , I , I did some research again , I , I followed what the procedures that the previous consultant had done . And then I , I kind of made it my own . I added things that I thought would be useful to our department , to our partners , to the public , cause I do work for a government entity . So I knew that all these things were important to , to look for . Um , it was definitely a long drawn out thing that we did , but I was , uh , I was confident that I could achieve it and I was happy with the results .","Um , one of the things I do in my office is I do a little bit of it support as well . Um , there was a time a few years ago where we had got hit by a ransomware , uh , attack and we had never had something like that happened to us before . We had to make , take quick steps to , to stop it from spreading . We had to , uh , get everybody in the office , you know , on the same page . And there was some people saying they were fine , they were fine , they didn't want to disconnect their computer , they wanted to keep working . There was other people that were very , uh , afraid of what was going to happen and they needed everybody to stop right then . So I got together with my superiors , we figured out a plan of attack and it had to be real quick . It was like a five , 10 minute thing that we figured out . And in the end , we , we stopped the ransomware . It did spread some , but it could have been way worse if we didn't catch it as early as we did . So I was probably the way we handled it , proud that we , you know , stopped , um , going any further and I'm happy that we had had a backup plan for something like that that happened . So all in all , we did have a good outcome from something that may have not been so good . Really .","Something . I'm not that great at it . My job is giving presentations and giving presentations to large groups , especially . Um , I just get really nervous about doing it . But , uh , for the report that I talked about previously , I had to give a presentation basically on this to a pretty big group in our , in our facility . Um , I was really nervous . There was a lot of , uh , uh , pressure on me to do well , but the , my bosses wanted me to look good in our business to look good . So , um , I , I studied , I prepared myself for hours before it and I made sure that I knew what I was talking about with there's questions afterwards . Um , it didn't go perfectly , but it went well enough that my bosses were fine with it and I felt good enough that I knew what I was talking about , that I , I could stumble through it enough that I didn't look like a complete idiot .","One of the things I do is part of my job is I hire interns every year . Um , and there was some interns that had applied early and I kind of promised them that I thought I would probably hire them cause I saw their resume and they looked good for the job . However , when it came time to hire , we had a big , big emergency thing happen at work where we had to prepare for , um , some bigwigs from the state to come in . And when it came time , that was about the time we were supposed to hire these people . So in the end I ended up not getting to hire these interns because of the emergency that happened . Um , I apologized to them that I know I had made a commitment to them . I explained to them what had happened and actually the emergency was we didn't have the funds to hire the interns . I felt bad . I told them , you know , dude , please apply in the next year . We would definitely want to hire them if we could . But , uh , there's not really a lot I could do . I apologized to them , made sure they knew that we did get hired because of themselves , and that we would look forward to hopefully hiring them in the future .",4,2.666666667,3.333333333,2,1.666666667
61,P99d2da-h5pwfc,"Well , my previous shops , Romanian sales , I find a lot of the skills required to be a good sales person and being a good project manager . Um , what overlap and would be very similar . Um , as a worker it is very important to adapt to change constantly because of the fast pace . Um , and the industry that I work with , um , I find myself adapt readily to challenges . For example , there was one time actually fairly recently , um , where the entire company switched to a new CRM system . A lot of people are having hard time . Um , they were having a hard time , um , adjusting to the new platform . Um , we use , but I find myself being able to learn it and master the path platform fairly quickly .

Um , I find myself , um , being able to always meet those targets because I , um , whenever I get a new goal , I always make sure to outline the steps to take in order to reach that goal . Um , in fact , um , an example that came to mind was when I first started out in the industry , um , I did not have a lot of technical knowledge . Um , I know that a lot of them can be , um , trained on the job , but I thought some technical knowledge and some certification would help as well . So what I did was I enrolled , I enrolled in a related program at a nearby college and , um , took classes for the program and work towards it . Um , after about a year I got a certificate and I was able to , I find myself having a lot more knowledge in that field than I had , um , the four and , um , that really helped me in my current position .","Um , about a situation in which I needed to make an important decision quickly . Um , this reminded me of when I , um , a while back when I worked as a research assistant and one time I had to run a study in our lab . Um , our lab computers is stopped running , um , right before the start of the appointment . Um , so one of my colleague said , um , to wait for help , um , but my guts told me that , um , this wouldn't be right . Um , so I had to decide whether I should just try and fix it , um , you know , by that , or just wait for help or just unplug everything so that we could use another machine . I eventually went with the second option . So instead of , you know , crossing my fingers and hoping that things , um , work out fine , I sprung into action to create an immediate solution that worked out perfectly . In the end .","Uh , one of my , one of the jobs that I've had was working as a sales person , um , at a rental housing company . So in that job , um , it was quite stressful , um , a lot of the times because I've often had to deal with difficult clients , um , and , and tenants . So lieutenants would come to me with all sorts of problems from maintenance to payment issues and things like that . Um , one thing I've learned in situations like that is to be patient and just let them do the talking first . Um , what I , um , always remind myself to do is to stay calm and that's a first thing . Um , and the most important thing actually , um , make note of their complaint . I always try to provide solutions to um , fix the problem . If it's something that I cannot solve on the spot , I make sure to work with the appropriate department or the appropriate person and follow up with the client afterwards to see if the issue has been resolved . Um , so the key point , the key takeaway for me is that even when dealing with a difficult person or a stressful situation , it is really important to stay calm and be rational . Um , and , you know , keep a record of every conversation we have .

Um , so yeah , I do always , um , get interrupted , um , when I'm trying to get things done . Um , however , what I do is I make a to do list and I actively review it . Um , every now and then , sometimes like twice or maybe more times a day . Um , I actively review it to make sure that I get everything done and that my supervisors can , or my colleagues can see my progress very clearly . Um , this has helped me to , um , even though it , it is hard , um , because it is a fast paced , um , situation and it's hard .

62,P7iks6r-emd354,"I think the Covidien and teen pandemic presented a situation where there were lots of , uh , both changing and complex environments in my work , which is in emergency human services . Um , we had lots of change because the funders of our services who you might think of in this situation as being like clients , uh , had all sorts of directives that they were developing for best practices , direction that they were receiving from government and public health agencies . Uh , and complex because these are essential services . We're not necessarily able to just suspend them because people depend on them for their wellbeing . Um , and in some cases for their , you know , their lives . Um , so the approach that , uh , that we took that I was a part of kind of leading a coordinating was to assemble two teams , one of which was an emergency response team . They were responsible for reviewing , um , sort of these nitty gritty , um , details and policies and recommendations that were coming through . And the other was a programmatic team who responsible for looking at our programs and deciding how can we adjust our , our , you know , our activities . How can we do this ? In a way that is both safe while still meeting the needs of the people who are serving . Uh , in other words , kind of ensuring the quality of our product . So , uh , that was a situation or it has been a situation really where , you know , it has involved a lot of coordination between those two teams . A lot of meetings , a lot of evaluating our best practices , a lot of responding to changes as they've continued to come through and be adjusted to , you know , as we learn more and more and policies change and requirements change . Um , and in a situation where we're not only responding to those things , but as our funders kind of make more funding available , uh , as part of their emergency response , sort of a , um , system there . Um , we're looking to also demonstrate that we've been responding in an effective way and that we can , uh , utilize further funding to continue to , uh , see those programs run well . So , uh , it has definitely been a time of change and complexity , but , um , something where we really had an opportunity to , um , flex and look closely at how we run our programs . And , and how we can basically deliver the best possible product to , uh , to our clients .","About five years ago , we decided that one of the buildings that our organization owns , uh , was not being utilized , uh , to the maximum of its potential . It was an older building that needed a lot of work and we decided that rather than invest the money into refurbishing the existing building , the best course of action would actually be to demolish it and completely rebuild it as a new facility , um , with a completely different purpose . Um , we're a not for profit agency , so at the idea of taking on a multimillion dollar multi-year capital project was , uh , you know , no small undertaking , uh , and it really involved buy in and participation from staff , uh , in , in many areas of the organization and a lot of working with contractors out the org outside of the organization as well . Uh , so the principle concerns were raising sufficient funds to actually complete the project , um , and uh , and doing so in a cost effective way . That also was going to be , uh , meeting a variety of different meats . So that involved , uh , a lot of steps really . First of all , we had to relocate staff who , uh , were currently working at the building , um , at that time . So that involved some meetings , some explanation of the longterm , uh , vision for the project and , uh , and problem solving as far as where we could relocate staff to and , and programs for the duration . We had to assemble a committee on our board to , uh , select an architect and really sort of be the quarterbacks for the actual building component of it . And we had to , uh , bring together a fundraising committee , which consisted of both , uh , board members and staff and some outside partners who had been , um , fundraising partners with us in the past . Uh , and so through the , uh , the board section , we were able to identify an architect , work with them , uh , in a way that was , uh , both within our budget . And we actually also managed to , um , achieve a really innovative new building that , uh , that had some very interesting environmental and eco-friendly features to it . And then through our capital campaign , that's actually still ongoing . Um , but we have raised several million dollars , uh , through government funders , private donors , um , and community donors . And we are continuing to work on raising the last one point $2 million currently . But , um , we are , uh , very optimistic that we're going to be hitting that goal . And as a result of , uh , all of that planning and action , we took full occupancy of the building last November and there are programs , uh , now running out of it exactly as envisioned . So it was a successful project in the end that we are , uh , trying very near to completing in a way that we're very satisfied with .","And we had a very , um , challenging situation where a funder had asked us a very straightforward question about a program that they were funding , which basically was , are you going to have all of the funds for the program spent by the end of the eligible program spending period . I know in the private sector , clients are usually hoping to hear that you're in under budget , but in this case , they were wanting to hear from us that all of the funds that had been allocated to us were fully spent . Uh , and now I was hearing from the , uh , program sort of lead , uh , who was responsible for actually kind of delivering the program that he has . All of the funding had been spent , uh , and that they were on track to meet the funder's requirements . Um , but our accounting department , uh , a junior staff member had let me know that they had had a conversation with , uh , our , our senior accountant where they had indicated that they were concerned about the eligibility of some of the expenses and they might not , uh , be fully spent within the project period . That senior accountant was away from the office and the funder was looking for a response as quickly as possible . So I was caught between , um , the person who is kind of directly involved with the spending of the budget , who was saying yes and someone who is a little more tangentially connected but has some information that possibly the , the program lead doesn't , who is saying no . Um , and so that was a situation where I felt , you know , uh , it's , it's a better safe than sorry situation . We don't want to over commit to something and then not follow through on it . Um , and , and we need response for this funder . So I ultimately decided to tell the funder , you know what , I'm actually hearing different things . Um , we have , uh , spent the full budget amount , but there's some concern about the eligibility that we're going to have to review a little bit more closely . If it's okay , I'd like to be able to get you a firm answer tomorrow . Once I've had an opportunity to look through all of the spending , review our agreement and confirm the eligibility of all the expenses . Um , and that was a , an acceptable response . They were , um , okay . With hearing that there was a chance that the answer was no , it was helpful for them to have that on the radar . That that was a possibility . Once we did actually get a chance to review the information , it turned out that the concern about the ineligible expense , uh , was not relevant . It did fall within an eligible cost category and we were fully spent . Um , so we were able to go back to the funder with good news and say , yes , everything is on track . Um , and , and I was glad that it was a case where I was able to prepare them for a negative outcome and then , uh , you know , sort of surprise them with a positive one rather than a situation where I had committed to something that we wouldn't ultimately be able to deliver .","You know , this is maybe a slightly a different story from what you might hear from people who primarily worked in the private sector . But as I mentioned , um , I do work in human services and some of those services are immune emergency human services , including an overnight shelter space . And when we had just started up that space , um , you know , we had been working on getting word out to other shelters in the area and hospitals and the police that this was , uh , an overnight space . So if they had no room or , uh , they needed a place to , uh , to direct , uh , members of the homeless community in our city , it was an option for them . Well , something got a little lost in translation . And on the first night we had a police officer show up and drop off a woman who had just been stabbed , um , and was in need of medical attention and then left . Um , and so I found myself , uh , alone at to , at the building late at night and a woman who had just been dropped off who had recently been violently assaulted and needed some medical attention . Um , and , and the people who I would normally call the police were actually the ones who had just dropped her off and then left really without leaving , uh , much recourse . Um , now usually in an after hour situation like that , there is an on call person who I would reach out to . Um , but in this case I felt like it was something that needed a quick response . Um , you know , this woman was in pain and , and as far as I could tell suffering from a very serious injury . So it was a case of having to contact the hospital and to coordinate with them and , and do some information sharing as well . It was a situation where I want it to be acting quickly and clearly and directly because there was a person's wellbeing , um , at question . Uh , but also I wanted to make sure that there was a strong plan for going forward . I didn't necessarily want this woman to go to the hospital and then be ending up back out on the street without a place to go again . So we worked with the hospital team to establish a plan to have her picked up , taken to the hospital and looked at and then , um , be brought back to , uh , the shelter afterwards to make sure that she had a place where she could stay once she was discharged . Uh , we also did some , uh , working with the police , uh , after that situation , um , to coordinate a little bit better about how we can manage , um , situations where a little bit more emergency response might be needed or , or where a little bit more assessment of what the most appropriate place , uh , for someone to be dropped off might be based on , you know , the context of the situation . Um , so it was a , it was something where we had to do a lot of work after the fact to continue to establish some of those systems to respond well . Um , but in the moment , uh , it was just a case of needing to , um , act decisively with both a short term and longterm view on how we wanted to achieve a positive outcome .","We actually have a bit of a running joke at our organization about a line that appears in all of our employment contracts and describing the job duties . It's the final , uh , line in the job description for all positions that says other duties as required . Um , and as I've kind of alluded to throughout , so , you know , I'm , I'm working in an organization that has a lot of different services of various , uh , various natures , uh , and it's not uncommon for people to be called on to do some work outside of their normal scope , uh , and that might be urgent or high priority or even emergency . And , uh , in some situations . Um , during a snow storm recently we had , uh , a total blockage of the roads in our city . Um , and at that point we were actually also experiencing an outbreak among some of our staff . So we had a limited roster of staff who provide the food for the people who stay at our emergency shelter . Um , and the staff who were available who were not sick , uh , weren't able to get in because they weren't able to travel on that day . Basically because of the road conditions . I live fairly close to the facility . Um , and so I made myself available for , um , making sure that we had food on site , um , through picking some , some food up and taking it over to the building to drop it off . But because of the conditions of the road and needing to travel back and forth from a restaurant to the the facility , it was , um , a significant time commitment for the day on a day when , um , I had committed to taking care of some other important priorities for reports that were , uh , due to some of our funders on , uh , on , you know , uh , use of funds and protrude program activities , things like that , that they had set up a fairly firm deadline for later that week . It was important to me , um , to make sure that the , the needs of the people at the shelter were being met because those are , um , in a lot of ways , the , the whole reason that we do the work . Um , so I made time during the day to be able to go and take care of that . Um , and the simple solution for me was to just put in some after hours work to make sure that we could fulfill our obligations to our funder as well . Um , because those were commitments that we had made to them in the same way that providing that food and shelter is a commitment that we make to the people we serve . So , um , it was a case where I felt that , you know , just putting in a little bit of extra time and a little bit of extra effort , um , was something that needed to happen in order to make sure that , uh , that everyone who we had made commitments to , uh , have those commitments fulfilled .",4.333333333,4,4,4.333333333,3.666666667
63,Pu9gfci-bax2bt,"Well , this isn't the time . I doubt that would work , but I could put myself in this position as when I was , um , the senior at university . I was volunteering at a local YMCA for children . Um , during this of them , there was a fundraiser and there was an issue because the speaker systems were working or had a lot of people in the Williams who haven't been here before society to take it upon myself to grab the megaphone , which is in the storage room , and used it to direct where the people or the fundraisers should go . So then they wouldn't be lost . And for me doing , I ended up causing a whole lot of mishaps .","No . My past experience as a project manager , there was times where , um , in terms of where par a team member or project member would fall sick or not be able to come in or basically just they're most out caused the level of project to me . But I had to take it upon myself to make sure that everyone was in tune with the progress of the project . Whether that means emailing the progress you made today , keeping them updated where they have the company when they come back , boom . There's been times where we've had a client complain about the projects we are running , but I have decided to take it upon myself to talk to the clients , to let them be completely informed and be completely transparent about the situation so that all our clients can be out .","The situation where to make an important decision quickly was when multiple team members have a project goes really mean .

So suddenly just taking someone's word for inside of the way in the two options , which better make me find though that there was just a perfect point April four B , but the two clash could have problem . Those are C . So I used those problems and I used the different information people to get it to fix the issue .","Well , Tom , where we thought the star high pressure situation was on during my work eating with my partner and we were presenting , we'll meet . I was the best idea for the project . This was during Colvin 19 times . We were all online and the internet went down from my partner , so he couldn't really be a part of the presentation , but I had to take it upon myself to present as part of the presentation so that not only could we keep the presentation moving forward , but we could showcase the idea that we wanted to present to the other project managers .","Well , a time where I faced difficulty keeping a commitment to my priorities at work was when we had a group project . I was supposed to compete at a certain new time and I'm missing a progress . We heard it would look like we couldn't finish it at the projecting due time . And that was mostly due to me juggling projects at work and checking in with other coworker . Then seeing how the progress of other projects were . So I said , extend the project new day .

64,Pswae9r-7iwnqs,"When I first got hired during coven at a tech company in downtown Toronto , I struggled because I was onboarded fully remotely in a brand new environment where they were changing the website as well as the mobile app and the background system , um , at the same time . So if there was something new to learn , um , I and the client and all our customers would have learned it at the same time . Um , so the steps I took to overcome this , um , I definitely tried to act like a sponge . I consumed as much information as I could , taking my own notes , um , practicing doing demos , um , listening into every zoom meeting , um , and just really immersing myself into the environment as well as the different platforms that we were using . And , um , definitely doing trial and error . Um , and the outcome of that was amazing . Uh , I ended up being the , um , top , uh , tester , the QA tester , which allowed me to really learn , uh , from the point of view of a customer , um , and how we can assist them better .","I recently had a project at work where I was supposed to interview 250 users of our mobile app , um , to really understand how we could better the app as well as , um , keep the product roadmap in check . Sorry . Um , so the steps that I took to reach that goal , I definitely started with a Google sheet , um , inputting all the different information I needed from every user as well as , um , sending out a blast email to all the users , uh , participating in the QA testing . Um , and just from there , I really , um , started attacking one by one . Uh , whoever would answer first . And , uh , surprisingly I was really excited to know that most people were very , are ready and willing to provide information , uh , which definitely sped up the process . Um , and we definitely completed the project in time . Uh , what I definitely learned from that is to definitely prioritize , take leadership in what you need to do and just go for it .","Um , I was in a situation at work where I was in between two different departments . Uh , one of them being risk and compliance and the other one being customer success . Um , the decision I had to really make was in terms of a user , um , whose actions on the platform were not aligned with our own . Um , what I ended up doing , uh , because I was getting multiple , uh , conflicting informations , uh , whether to off board or to keep on the platform . Um , I decided to offboard the user . Um , but the difference in this , uh , situation is I definitely prepared , um , a whole sheet explaining why the reasoning behind why I chose to offboard , uh , just because I was waiting in between two departments and , um , the user was also waiting . So I definitely took it in my own hands . And , uh , it ended up being the right decision for everyone involved .","Uh , so there was a time , uh , where I went through a stressful situation at school , um , during my university program , mainly because I was commuting , um , over two hours each way . Um , and most of the group members in my project for this one class were all living on campus . Um , so the situation was just a lack of coordination to work on our group project , which was due next week . Um , how I responded to that was I really just focused on keeping clear communication within the group , uh , suggesting video chats , um , as well as making the effort to stay a bit longer on campus so that way we could all collaborative collaboratively work on the project , um , on campus , which was a comfortable space for everyone . Um , and the outcome of that was it was really a great decision .

And also , um , I have to prioritize . Um , so what I chose to do is I , uh , used one of my favorite programs , uh , called JIRA and I organized by department all the requests and I work to complete them one by one . So for example , for this week I would complete one from the risk department , one from customer success , one from product .

65,P94u9k8-7553pf,"Okay . So I was working on a project for a software and has been a software enhancement . Now part of the project is that there are many stakeholders involved from the business to the project team and also the it or development team . Um , so as there's many pieces involved , my role in this project , more like a project manager slash business analyst . Um , so what it did at first was create a project plan . This includes all the various tasks , activities and also the timings like how much time is needed . And from there I was able to help break out pieces up , break out a deliverables out , um , that I would think other teams would need to take . Like for example , development team , how much time is need for development , how much time is needed for QA , how much time is needed for UAT , uh , or user acceptance testing . Um , so first I CA I put myself in their own shoes , uh , provide my estimates on how much time is required . After that , then I've worked with all different stakeholders to go through my project time and to get their feedback . If they say that they need less time or more time , or if there's additional activities that needed that needs to be captured that I've included in my project plan . So as a result , uh , due to this complex project with multiple stakeholders , I was able to , um , organize it , a project plan , uh , in addition , uh , getting their feedback into a project that was helpful because it helped me get a three 60 awareness of all the different team members , all the different teams and their activities and being able to document it correctly . As a result with this project , uh , any changes along the way of this project , I can easily amend as part of project plan , uh , in addition to price transparency to myself and all the various stakeholders on where we're at in the project and identify any risks or concerns , um , pertain to any specific tasks , uh , for each team .","So we can never reach my previous , uh , answer . So part of the project plan pro , part of that context project is that there's so many moving pieces and also concurrent activities now does definitely does , definitely . We'll definitely do some activities that might cause a cause delay such development time . Um , for instance , we give two weeks of development . However , during the process they counter many bugs and issues that had to increase development time to , there's no one and a half weeks . Now in that case , what it did is it part of the project plan , I had to push everything out . So that includes any subsequent or any subsequent activities . In addition , in addition , uh , I had make like weekly updates , um , and also like more like status updates for my stakeholders . So I put that as a risk st eight for development , for unable to meet our timelines , um , due to number of bugs and issues . However , here's the updated timelines , uh , as a result , um , like as a result of this , it provides , I mean , are unable to meet our exact timings . However , um , not , nothing ever goes to plan . However , because I was able to prep it , more transparency , uh , and then my stakeholders know , then it will clear up any air and getting a understanding of where we're at in the project . Um , so as a result , it's always what I always do is provide communication to my stakeholders by finding them any issues that we're having . Uh , then there would be able to understand , or what's hap , uh , there'll be able to understand due to , uh , the transparency of information given , and also able to see the update timelines . If we do have an issue .","Yeah . So I'm , I'm working on a bunch of software enhancements and we had one issue faced by production users where , uh , where it field was breaking . So data was being lost whenever you make updates . Uh , and that's , uh , affecting production users because they have to , because what our information died , they had ordinate disappears . Uh , and they had to get to , what we have to do from an it perspective is that we had to get developers to update the field in the backend . Uh , however it does need to be fixed as soon as possible . So what I did was that Aboriginal developers to come up with a quick fix to get this fixed so then the business can start using some good start , uh , using the product as usual and our expenses issue . However , another person , uh , however , this fix is not like a permanent fix . It's more of a temporary fix . So , but at business at the nod like to work around , um , it just creates more work . However , the fixed meets their intent . However , they just have to know that there's a work around needed . Uh , they didn't like that . In addition , another , uh , tech lead , he did not like this fixed because also felt Packy just due to it's a temporary fix . You might as well have , you know , proper , you know , full fish solution to address this issue . So they wanted to be an issues but big , but doing , going towards that path is that Oh , it takes longer time to develop . It needs to go through testing . Um , so as a result you're doing multiple complex , right ? Uh , no , the business was one thing . We have a temporary solution where the business can start working tech lead . Um , what did a more permanent solution ? So what , uh , so what happened was that , you know what , you had to find the optimal , uh , solution because you cannot satisfy everyone . Um , so I had to explain to business who are ultimately the final decider , uh , decision maker that Hey , okay , we can , uh , address some of your concerns but not all of your concerns due to a bunch of limitations . Uh , and you want to start using this as soon as possible , then we can use this workaround . But if you don't want to give , you want a full fledged permanent solution , and that means it would take a very long time to fix . So I keep those options to the business and it was up to , for them to decide . I give the pros and cons of each option . Um , and as a result , uh , I leave it up to them to give to final decision . Uh , in that case , you know , when you can't please everyone , but you just have to provide all the various options to the business to make it volunteer decision .","So part of my team , uh , I am a team lead for the QA team . Um , one of the high pressure of stress position at work was that we were going live into production , um , on Saturday and today's date is Friday . Now we encountered numerous issues that need that would impact going live in production . Um , so what happened was , uh , we need you to get to get all these fixes fixed by Deb for the development team and then for the QA team to validate that these fixes actually do work . Now , um , what happened was that audio pixels are coming in last minute , like in the afternoon where people's going log off . Uh , how I cope in this situation was that , um , I had to cookie delegate these tasks to my QA members . I tell them , um , uh , well , first is to reprioritize our work . Uh , so our priority is for these defect retest . In addition , uh , it's also working with , uh , the other like duck that team to say , Hey , uh , does our afternoon know a lot of people are logging off . We can do as much as we can . We can retest all of them , but , um , but we were able to retest , you know , whatever we can in the time limit that we have . Right . So any other issues , any other fixes ? We just have to , uh , inform the business saying that , Hey , we cannot retest that your thing . Um , we can be tested after we go on production . If there's any other fixes , then we'll just make a patch and fix those defects that failed . Great . So in that situation , it's more , um , reprioritizing your work , uh , getting everyone or all my team members involved . So that includes a lot of delegation . Uh , because for myself , I have to , I cannot do it for myself . So in that case , I had to , um , just understand all the tools and resources that I have and you utilize them And also move , evolve , move in a sense of urgency to get it done .","So my current job , I have multi hearted , I have many tasks that work on many projects at the same time . So in this case , uh , this case I worked with many stakeholders with also no contract activities and also a parallel , like , like overlapping timelines in this case , um , you know , I'm working on a project or multiple projects , um , I provide timelines to all my stakeholders and some of them I cannot commit and that happens on frequently frequent basis . So what I have to do , well , what I have to do is know what I tried to any other as a lesser priority work or delegate to other team members . Um , I'll also work , um , Oh , work a bit more just to make up any work I have to get done . But if all those fail , what have do is I just keep my steakhouse transparent because for each project I'm working on , I know the priority of these projects . If I don't , I'll go out to Misha steak or Hey , what's the priority and why is that priority urgent , right ? If it's , if it's urgent , why is it urgent ? Um , so there I'm able to actually prioritize , okay , which one is actually urgent ? Is it urgent ? Because in the end , as they go , they treat everything as urgent but truly to not really urgent . So it's morning setting , stakeholder expectations . So anything that I cannot meet on time or we talk to steak order telling them , Hey , I cannot reach this . I cannot meet my commitment due to the fact that I had to work on these regular like more urgent issues and I'll give them a heads up that Hey , these are more urgent because it has to do with me . It could be like audit finding , right ? So that needs to get done as soon as possible . Um , other than that , as small as just keeping an eye on , transparent on , on expectations , uh , it's just , Hey , if I cannot meet it , then just provide brand new timeline and saying that , Hey , I can't meet a certain date but give me , you know , two more days and I can meet it . Right . So it's just keeping them in the loop . Um , as a result of this , um , most coaches are very , um , they don't argue back , like , they understand that , yeah . Hey , this is a big project where I can work on many projects . I've seen time . Uh , as long as you give them a good reason , they're able to accept it .",4.333333333,2.666666667,4,3.666666667,2.666666667
66,P7ke4hi-3pm8t6,"Yeah , I can absolutely talk about that . So , uh , the , I'm sure so many people have stories like this , but , uh , after the pandemic hit , things were a little interesting at work . Uh , so as you know , I work at a call center that , uh , produces interpreter phone calls . Uh , and our business went through the roof after the pandemic hit because so many people were , were home . They wanted to call and check up on their , uh , friends and family . And so we had a problem because all of our employees work in call centers and they work in cubicles that are very close to each other . And that was a health safety concern . So we had to figure out a way to get probably close to a thousand interpreters to be able to work from home . That included getting technology for their , uh , at home setups . I included it . It was just a whole supply chain . We had to go buy hundreds of laptops for these interpreters , go send them home . We were able to do it within two weeks , but that , um , on an operational side of things created an kind of a logistical nightmare because we had to figure out how to , uh , schedule when only some people were going into the actual interpreting center and some people were working from home . And , um , we have to figure out even how to , uh , adjust our policies and procedures for working within a home office rather than working in a cubicle . Because , uh , for example , teamed calls , you can't really call someone to come in , sit down next to you , plug in and help , uh , assist , uh , the interpretation of the call when you're working from home and there's no one else working with you . So that was an issue for our it department to get on and work on that . And then they created the remote teaching capabilities , but then we had to train the interpreters on that and work through all the tech issues . So like everything that happened to be able to create that move for the interpreters to go work from home affected the way that we did our business . And it , like I said , it happened in about two weeks that everyone went to work from home or about half of our workforce went to work from home and we just had to hit the ground running and EMP . It wasn't until maybe July or August that we even had a moment to breathe because every single week it was a joke within our department . Every single week our job was different because of new things that were happening were changing and the rapidly evolving a situation with a pandemic . So we just had to keep going with it and it was tough , but we managed to pull through fantastically .","I can absolutely talk about a time like that . So I'm about a year and a half ago , I , myself and a coworker of mine were approached about a project that , um , the committee was interested in assigning us . So the committee was a committee for , um , helping us transfer from doing data analysis in one database to a different database . And we were being tasked . My coworker , Jane and I were being tasked with creating a , a training for , uh , two different departments that would be using the database . And , uh , we were to develop the training on it and uh , yeah , do it for about 200 people in these two different departments . And we , neither of us had ever had like a project this big before , but we were really excited about it because we were really interested in , uh , we were transferring over to Tableau and we're really , really interested in Tableau's capabilities and , um , how it would really help change the way that we saw , um , data analysis for our call center , me metrics . And so we , uh , my coworker , Jane and I sat down and we created like a timeline of when we wanted certain steps for this project and presentation done because , um , we actually had already started using Tableau . And so we wanted to make sure that people kind of knew how it was best to utilize this program when it came to data analysis . And so we said set it up and we were on track for the first about three weeks . And then we had our first mock presentation with the committee and it did not go well because when the , uh , head of the committee had initially met with us few weeks prior and debriefed about the project that she wanted us on , she didn't give us the exact specifications that they were actually looking for , or perhaps she didn't communicate it in a way that , uh , was understood by us . So that was a huge step . Uh , uh , that was a huge setback . And then because of external circumstances , we actually had to postpone for about two months later . And then when that rolled around , there were other issues and it , the project actually got axed eventually because we decided to go from Tableau to , um , power BI VI , I think , except then we didn't . But that's a whole nother story for a whole nother day . And you're not here for stories , but you're here for what I was able to do and what I was able to do is just keep moving through the conflicting information that I was getting graciously and able to take the feedback and work it into something that I thought would have been really great if I had been able to present it .","Yeah , I can definitely talk about a situation like that . So , uh , one of the hospitals or one of the jobs that I had previously was working as a patient care interpreter scheduler at a hospital for a hospital system within the city I was living in and I was scheduling American sign language interpreters for patient care appointments . And we also have a pager for an on call interpreter because we have , uh , in , in that city , there are many deaf people who live there . So ASL is a very important language to have at your disposal or for , to have an interpreter at your disposal when you , uh , work at a hospital . So with patient care or with pager coverage , it can be really tricky trying to do handoffs . Um , especially when the interpreter who was coming to get the pager is running late and the interpreter who has to leave still has the pager . Um , and so Usually in that situation it w it wasn't too difficult to figure out what to do . Usually there's like one or two people , uh , in the interpreter , uh , like S central hanging out station . It wasn't really officially named . It was kind of an annex II room , uh , where they would kind of hang out and look at patient charts and whatnot , uh , prepping . But , um , they , they don't actually have access to charts , just like prepping information , reading medical things anyway . So , uh , usually it be able to go in there and find someone who would be able to cover for about 15 , 20 minutes , uh , gap coverage . But sometimes there'd be no people there . Sometimes they would say , Hey , Oh , well I can't do this , but I know Jessica Jessica's coming in like five minutes and she always comes early and you know , she doesn't start her next job until like , you know , three o'clock . So she'll be fine to take it . Like , sometimes you just have to work with people and trust that they know information that you may not necessarily have . Um , but sometimes people have conflicting information . So it's also really important to just kind of use your intuition and your gut judgment . And usually it worked out okay on my end . Sometimes I did have to hold the pager . I'm not interpreter , but , uh , there was one employee on premises who was an interpreter , but didn't do any patient care because she was a managerial . So I could have just gotten her to go to the ER if necessary . But I mean , I had backups , but it could be a very stressful Canac situation . But thankfully , it , uh , never failed .","I can absolutely talk about a time like that . Uh , it was spring semester 2013 I was just about to graduate from community college with my two associates degrees and I was working 20 hours a week . No , I was working 23 hours a week with two different jobs . I had an internship for 12 to like 20 hours a week depending on the week and I was doing a lot of honors things . I was on student Senate , I was the student Senate secretary and I was also preparing my childhood home to be sold that summer and I had to do it all while applying for um , you know , universities that offer bachelor's degrees and trying to navigate , um , changing social dynamics within my friend group . And there were just , it was just a culmination of a lot of different things all at once . And I believe that that point in my life is what set me on my path today . I was able to handle everything on my plate . I was able to gracefully let go of things that were no longer necessary . I was able to thrive in what I was doing in the moment and be able to focus in the moment on what I was doing and not worry about everything else that was happening . I am proud to say that I did graduate with honors , uh , Coon latte and from five beta Kappa two or I graduated with , I was involved when five beta Kappa , which is an honors , uh , fraternity for two year institutions and I was able to get the house ready and we sold it like a week after I graduated and I got accepted into my dream university . I was able to focus enough that I was , I could put in the time and effort necessary for The Application for the university that I later attended , which was the perfect fit for me . And I think that my composure and my focus and my drive and dedication during those several months that I was a very busy . I think it definitely helped me out . And then later at the end , the last semester of my , uh , time at the four year institution I attended , I was working full time , had a 40 hour week job while also taking two classes , one of which was my honors thesis . And I went into the library for hours every day after work . And I think I was only able to do that because of my prior experience in 2013 .","I can definitely talk about a situation like that . So at my workplace , the way that we are assigned tasks is very direct . Usually the supervisor will just say , Hey , are you free for a quick call ? And then they'll call you and explain what you're doing now . And Hey , training starts tomorrow at 10:00 AM have fun and , but sometimes there isn't even training at all . It can be very , here's what you're doing and have fun figuring it out . There can be a lack of direction or leadership , which is frustrating when you're given a new task . So typically our workload is as such , where if we were given something like this that you have to start doing immediately , there's enough flexibility within your day that you can plan your day and plan your workflow around it . But sometimes , especially when you don't have the , uh , the supervision or the S the support that you really need , then it can be a lot harder for you to focus on your current obligations . And so one thing that I have been , or it's been happening a lot recently where I've been given new things and not really necessarily had the support system . We're going through a restructuring currently and no one really knows what they're doing . And uh , there's been a lot of times where people said do this , but there's no blueprint on how to do it or who do I even ask to get access to that , um , server . Like it's , it's very confusing right now . So , um , right now what I have been doing is I have been telling people who are less effective , people that I work with who are less effected by this restructuring . Um , first of all I've been apologizing . I haven't been able to like hold up my specific end of our work relationship . Um , sort of like power dynamic I guess . Um , but I've been asking those people to help a little bit more to be just on the lookout a little bit more on time cards to make sure everything's good and things don't fall through the cracks on my end . Well , I'm trying to get all of this covered . And so just being very open and forthright with the people it is negatively effecting has been hugely beneficial to me . I've had people reach out to me proactively being like , Hey , I saw that this didn't get done . This is , I've , I've prepped it all for you . You just have to input it . Great . Thank you . I appreciate it . When people recognize that sometimes this happens and I'm very sorry , but can , can you just be flexible with me because I do have a track record of being flexible with them , so I'm just glad that there's reciprocity in the work relationship , but that's , that's just what I've been doing and it has been working really well .",4,2.666666667,2,3.333333333,2.666666667
67,Pqkjyut-3i4c9x,"One example of when I had to adapt to a changing our complex environment at work is when I was hired on to be a project manager or program director for a program that was , uh , already running . And the program had already secured , um , a partnership with a very large international organization that , uh , that had put forth an initiative to for smaller organizations to give them sort of , um , startup money . Uh , and it was sort of a plan of the five year plan to where the money , the funding that they would receive with was planned to sort of decrease over time . And the program would use those years of support to , um , as sort of a stepping stone to figure out , to get their footing and figure out how they wanted to do things and to then generate funding on their own . So I came in , in , uh , in the midst of this program . And so it was , it was already changing from , uh , at the very beginning and continuously changing . Although I did know that it was going to continue to change . Um , and so my job was to continue to , uh , to figure out a way to maintain the level of service that the program was providing to the community as well as increase our visibility and awareness within the community . Um , because people don't take advantage of programs that they don't know about and as well to figure out a way to , um , to increase the funding or maintain the funding so that we could continue to operate the way that they had been operating or even better . So one of the steps that I took was , uh , I'm a firm believer in partnership and so to take a look around and to find , uh , resources that might not be apparent at first sight , but are already existing within the community . When you can partner with , if you look around and you , you can see different programs or projects happening and if your goals align , then that is potentially a great resource . Right there . I was able to partner with different community organizations and in so doing network within the community , increase the program's visibility with the awareness of the program within , within the community that we were attempting to serve , as well as , uh , you know , sometimes you need the funding to do a certain resource , but if you to or to , to , to secure a certain resource . But if you're able to , through your networking and through your mutually beneficial partnerships , have that resource without the funding , then you have done your job and you've done it well . So that was the outcome of the steps that I took .","I think one of the main things that you have to do when you're setting a goal that seems difficult to achieve or is going to take , uh , quite a bit of effort and you know , this from the outset is , um , making the steps to the goal , uh , explicit , um , for yourself , but also for those anyone that you want to involve in the journey to the goal . So , um , I really believe in partnership , um , as a leader of an organization , um , one of the best things that you can do is listen , listen to , um , the valuable input that the people who are working with you have . Um , and so when you listen , then you will understand , you , you have a better vision of what your goal actually is and the steps that you need to take to get there . So one of the main steps , of course , once you have determined your goal is to make that vision very , very clear and to make the steps to the goal very clear , um , and make each step along the way . A mini goal in and of itself . Uh , so , um , setting a goal for a project where I was leading a group that was having to do a performance and I made many goals along the way so that they kind of bolstered the , the , the , the morale of the team . Like , well , we've made this goal . Okay , we know that our main goal is there . I'm not , not , uh , we're not hiding it or anything like that , but we know that we have that main goal . But let's celebrate along the way . Um , the goals that we have , uh , when we reach , when we reach our milestones and our mini steps , celebrate each one and each one , if we can clearly see that each step along the way is leading us , is progressing us toward our goal , then we're much more satisfied in the journey to the goal . So those are some of the steps that I took to reach . I mean , goal .","So a situation in which I had to make an important decision very quickly . This happens often , uh , as a teacher . And so we are often having to make very quick decisions . And , uh , life around us is often changing because every day is going to be different . In this particular instance , um , the students had an exam that had been planned . Um , but apparently there were , there was some information that there was supposed to be also , uh , an assembly in the auditorium . The problem with this is if we went down to the auditorium , they would have less time to complete the exam . If they started the exam , we would miss the , uh , the presentation happening in the auditorium . Nobody knew exactly what the right answer , the correct answer was . So , um , when I'm faced with decisions such as those , I , I make the decision by asking myself , uh , which decision , if I am wrong , leads the leads to the least detrimental outcome . And so for myself , in that situation , um , I decided , well , I don't want to walk in . You never want to walk into a presentation while it is occurring . Um , and so if we go down to the auditorium and we go to the presentation and it's not happening , well , the students can come right back . I can ask their , the teacher that they're going to , um , after my period , if we can have a little bit more time so that the students can have enough time to complete their exam . But if they start the exam , we'll have to stop , go down to the auditorium , come back to the exam . They might have , you know , it will be more detrimental for them to have to start and stop and continue again . So we went down to the auditorium , and thankfully in this instance , uh , we were correct , but , um , where we , where we not correct whether or not correct , I know that that would have been , uh , not as detrimental as the other decision . So .","Coping with high pressure or stressful situations . Um , it depends on for me on if you know that that high pressure situation is going to occur in the future . So if you know that there's a deadline and it's , or you have the date of an event , then you can prepare a little differently than if the pressure suddenly comes on you . Uh , one such example , um , in my life is , uh , I was leading a group to our performance . I knew the date of the performance . It doesn't matter knowing the date , you still know that on that day it's going to be very , it's going to be a very high pressure situation because , uh , you need to be as close to perfect as you can be . In that instance , what I did , uh , I sort of tried to pre manage that stressful situation by taking a small sort of breaking up what we had to do into some sort of smaller manageable chunks . I also , um , have learned over time to delegate and not to try to bear all of the pressure by myself . And so what I did as well is some of the tasks that would , uh , ease my burden somewhat . I asked for help and I delegated some of those , uh , some of those tasks that made my , made my job easier and also made the whole group's journey to our high pressure situation smoother . Um , which was great . It also gave , I believe , to those who , um , were helping me with the task , a sense of ownership over the goal as well . And , um , I think when everybody feels that the part that they've played or the role that they have played was instrumental or integral in fact to the success of the whole group , it , it just makes the experience so much better and sweeter for everyone that's involved . So that is how I coped with the high pressure situation . Of course , uh , rehearsing over and over and over again . I'm a strong believer in , um , mental practice . And so even though what we were performing was , you know , wasn't mental , it was actual performance . Taking the time in the days leading up to rehearse over and over again . In my mind , I'm thinking of the things that could possibly what , what to do . Um , if this goes wrong , what to do if that goes wrong . Just thinking about it and managing made me feel a lot more prepared and I was able to manage that high pressure situation .","So I'm keeping a commitment that I made due to an other due to other important priorities has happened often . Um , or I've , I've been faced with that challenge often . Um , specifically in my , one of my daughters , I had a deadline , uh , and it was a pretty hard deadline . Uh , and , but I also had at the same time a performance with my other job to prepare a group for . And , um , at the same time I was dealing with some health issues . So these all made keeping that commitment , that first commitment difficult . And , and I did have difficulty . Um , the first deadline was my main priority , but the second deadline was happening whether I liked it or not as well of the performance date . So , um , I try to again , break up the , the work that I needed to do for the first priority , um , so that I could meet that deadline . However , uh , I did end up having to ask for an extension , um , because I just wasn't able , I didn't think I would be able to give the best , um , result or the best work to that first commitment . Um , if I just sort of handed it in , I knew it wouldn't , it wouldn't be the both the best work . So I did ask for an extension . I was granted the extension and I was able to complete my work for the first commitment , um , on the date of the extension . I think if I had it to do all over again , um , I think I would be more vocal about , uh , the pressure that I was under there or the other commitments . And I would have asked for that extension proactively more so than reactively . Um , it worked out in the end in a way , but I believe if I had said , I'm going to need a bit more time , I'm going to need another two days to finish this so that I could see in the distance that breathing room , uh , it probably would have been more professional of me , uh , to do it that way instead of the way that I had done it .",4,3.5,3.666666667,4.333333333,3.666666667
68,Pkkygcg-fag33z,"Hi . Uh , in my previous role as a project lead , I was handling a team of 15 people . And , uh , during recent past two years , uh , things had to be changed from , um , in-person to virtual , uh , because we are service providers . So we had to align with , uh , the new virtual culture and , uh , at the end of the day meet , uh , the sales targets as well . So , uh , since I was the lead , I , uh , I had to manage my resources accordingly and there were people who we had to like align in terms of how , how many people will be working from office and how many people are working from home . Um , I , uh , took the challenge and then the changing work environment . And , uh , I ensured that my team is aligned to the , uh , changing culture , changing work culture . And we made sure that , uh , everyone is given enough resources to comply with the , uh , the regulations of our services and also to ensure that they are able to deliver those services to our clients .","So , uh , this is about time of a decent time when everything opened back again , um , after covert . So , um , uh , my thing , they were all supposed to be in Boston now , like they have to start working from office . But uh , do you do , uh , ongoing , uh , um , home situation for a lot of people and a family situation for a lot of people , a lot of people were not in my team are not comfortable coming back to , um , office . Uh , so it initially it became really difficult to ask everyone to be at work and , uh , to make sure that they are agreeing to those systems to returning to office . Uh , but later I , uh , as a project lead , I took an initiative and I decided that , uh , let's not make it like a full time , uh , work from office . We took , uh , a hybrid culture . We adopted a hybrid culture where a few people can come in on certain days and remaining the norm on the other days . So then everyone is coming to office . Plus everyone is getting a chance to meet their family commitments at home . Um , by working from home and by working flexible hours , um , as , uh , required by if they have daycare or if they have , uh , if they have their good school or something like that , so they can adjust and adopt accordingly . Um , so yeah , so the result is pretty good . Uh , we are able to , uh , our sales targets have been achieved and we have been able to achieve more than 50% of the sales target , um , already have for the half year lease . So we , we are on good track .","So this is about a situation where in a river , uh , or to decide on some customer . And , uh , we had some regulations and compliance , uh , requirements that we had to meet in order to service that particular customer . But , uh , we were getting the two different or conflicting conflicting responses from our compliance team and our different , uh , uh , regulatory team . Um , and plus the sales team was on like a total different track . So , uh , we tried to get everyone on a call video call together so that we understand whether , uh , four days as per regulation is also as per the compliance for our company . And then , um , that our sales team is aligning to what is required . So , uh , the information that we were getting , uh , via it was conflicting . We read later realized was because there was a new policy that they are bringing in , which is ASCO , the new regulations and our compliance policy is still not updated because the other policy is still under process . So that's the reason they were conflicting . Uh , uh , information is coming from the two different teams . But , uh , uh , we dissolve this issue because we were , we got on a call together and that helped , uh , putting everyone's responses and everyone's understanding of the situation on the table , and we were able to , uh , respond accordingly .","So , um , this is definitely the fall time when , uh , initially covered or started and , uh , nobody was able to adjust to its , um , its affects , right . Uh , it had a lot of effect on our mental health as well . So , uh , this was the storage unit and , um , my team , uh , out of 15 people then people were not already to come to office and they were not ready to work , uh , in Boston . They wanted everything to be virtual , but because we are in services and we need some clearance from the regulatory or department of our organization , so we were not able to send everyone or allow everyone worked from home . Right . Because a awful lot of , uh , a lot of reasons that we can not share the data and security it and everything . So this was a situation where my Dean learned Clearlake refuse to come to the work and we had our August and we had everything that had to be achieved . But at the same time I had , I , I was ready to understand , uh , the effects this situation was having on their mental health because , uh , uh , there was no point in pressurizing them to do something that they were not ready to do . Uh , so we , uh , uh , all the managers we set up and set up kind of a meeting and then we spoke to our senior management and we made sure that everyone is allowed to work from home and the security protocols are met .","So this is definitely , or the recent , in recent times , I had some , uh , um , some goals to complete and , uh , because I was in a situation where , and I had a lot high blood pressure as well , and managing a team of people , I was not able to manage everything in one goal . So , uh , I prioritize my work over my personal , um , education . Right ? So I had , I was , I didn't have much time to prepare for my exam and , um , I was not able to pass the exam . That was , so that was the situation and I , uh , again taking , taking that particular exam and I have now ensured that I'm allocating time and resources properly . Like , uh , I'm just not , uh , ignoring this exam . Totally . So I'm making sure that I'm giving 109 hundred per person to both the things .",3.666666667,2.666666667,3,3.333333333,2.333333333
69,Pmuwtfb-99ijry,"In the previous work that I did , uh , working as a project manager , I worked at a university responsible for organizing the hiring for basically all the departments that didn't have their own human resource department . So it was kind of a popery of different departments as well as some of the , the highest level of departments , office of chancellor , et cetera . And about halfway into my tenure at that job , uh , we made some organizational changes . We were reporting to a different department , but still had to maintain quality relationships , uh , with all the relationship with all the departments that we were working with . Um , and so the steps that I took with , despite there being a lot of changes happening in the department , uh , I try to maintain my level of professionalism and high quality of service . And , uh , you know , when a lot of changes are happening in an organization , people look to those who are the coolest . Nicholas and I tried to , uh , project that as much as possible .","Several years ago , I had a very somewhat vague goal of getting the best job possible , working in the education system in a foreign country . And by best job possible , I meant , um , you know , something that I was , that I enjoy doing something that I was comfortable with and something that , that , you know , paid me a satisfactory amount . And in order to achieve this , um , I started by working at the best first job I could get working at a language Institute . Uh , and I developed good relationships there with my supervisor and coworkers and constantly , you know , at the same time , have I opened further opportunities . Uh , from there , uh , I , the next step I , I took was to find a job at a better school . It was a high school in the country . And , uh , you know , I continued developing my skills there . How did you learn how to do the job ? Continued fostering good relationships , uh , but I , you know , wanted to keep going . And , and from there , I , uh , got a job at a university in the city . And so I started with , with this vague goal of just , uh , doing something that I , that I love doing and a place where I love doing it and just looked , you know , kept my mind open , looking for what are , what's a better opportunity than , than what I'm doing right now . And I think that , uh , that really is the key to achieving goals is , is more like having an open minded system and , uh , taking improvements where you find them .","Well , referring back to my previous example , uh , when I wanted to work in the , in the education system in a foreign country , um , identified Columbia as the place where I went to work . And there wasn't a lot of information about working in Columbia , uh , much less working for this specific organization that had offered me a position . In fact , uh , there was some downright negative , uh , information about this organization that I had chosen to work with even though it was , it was a well known brand and a well known name . So , uh , there's kind of this several , uh , unknown variables happening here . Living and working in foreign country for a known brand , uh , that had negative reviews . Um , but kind of the mindset that I took was , look , I'm not going to get the best job in the country right away . Doesn't matter . Uh , how carefully I , um , I make this decision , I have to start somewhere . And I , the sooner I start the better . So ultimately I accepted this job and I had a very short amount , amount of time to do it . Um , I had , I had to make a decision , you know , in less than a week after receiving the offer , which is a big decision if you're leaving your country for a place that is very unknown to you and everyone that you know . So , um , I accepted , I accepted the position , and in the end it really worked out perfectly . It wasn't the best job in the city , but it was certainly far from the worst . And I think for , given my circumstances , it was , uh , just about , uh , the best decision that I could've made in one of the best decisions I've ever made . Certainly .","Um , prior to my experience working as an educator , I worked is a human resources manager , uh , specifically in a hiring role , um , facilitating hiring . Uh , but a very significant portion of my job was , uh , facilitating the , the job interview process , which is , uh , extremely , extremely complicated , especially when it's for a very high level position and , uh , you really have to impress these candidates . Um , you know , as , as a major university , um , you , you want to attract the best people and really you , you need them more than they need you . These people have , have plenty of options . So it was my job to really sell the university as a place to work in terms of making this , you know , their visit a , a dream come true as , as high quality as possible . And so , um , for example , we would hire like a Dean for the college of engineering at , at this university , and this would be multi day , um , multi day interviews . And I would prepare for literally months , uh , the , the , uh , each day of this interview , who would , who they would meet , where they would meet , what they would do , how long it would take , how they would get from point a to point B to C to D , how , how'd they get home , how did they get to the campus ? And , uh , my approach was just , uh , uh , meticulous , meticulous , uh , uh , meticulous , uh , preparation . I literally visited the , the places that the interviewee would , would revisiting . I tried to experience the interview myself as if I were that person and put myself in their place . It's really , uh , my response and approach was to , uh , involve myself as much as possible in the process imagining I were that person .","When I started working as an educator , uh , and ultimately as a university professor in Columbia , I came to find out that there were few people with , with my qualifications working down there . And when that's the case , you are very much in demand as , as a professional and as a , as a teacher . So , uh , there's only so many hours in a day and there's only so many opportunities that you can , that you can accept . I was often , uh , offered responsibilities by my department , uh , to participate in different activities in as often as possible . I said yes . Um , I think that when you , when you make yourself look like you're indispensable , um , then you're someone that , that your employer wants to keep . Uh , however , one time I was offered a , uh , to teach a course for preparation of a language proficient proficiency exam , and this would have required a significant time investment and , uh , the pay for it would not have been commensurate for the , the work that I was doing . Um , nor was this something that was particularly attractive to me for a future of my career . And it was a very high , high , uh , stress type work . And so , um , I declined this , this job in order to keep my commitments to , um , to the department that I was working for . Uh , sometimes you just have to learn to say no . Right ?

And the technologies , uh , we used in that project , um , were really different from the backend technologies . So at first it was a challenging and complex environment for me , but , um , through , uh , researching online and , um , uh , No going through the previous codes , uh , previous frontend codes and , um , asking questions in groups and in chats , I was really able to , uh , learn the front end code .

Um , at that time I , uh , realized all of those , uh , coursework and Ellen with my interview preparations were , um , a bit too much for me . But , uh , I , uh , bought some notepads to write the things that I need to do everyday . Um , and also I divided my time to do each of the tasks . And , um , also I focused on one task at a time , so that way , uh , by utilizing effective time management , by using , uh , uh , sticky notes and notepads , I was able to overcome that situation .","Um , so a few days ago I had a project at work , uh , which was , uh , really important and , uh , taking all of my times . Um , so I , um , at that time also I had , uh , a commitment to go out with my friends . Uh , but due to my work pressure , uh , I couldn't go out . Um , so , uh , that was a situation that I experienced two days ago . But , um , uh , at that moment , I , um , uh , reevaluated , um , the importance of , of both the tasks and , uh , I , uh , set out to do , um , the tasks that I have had , uh , at my work . And I , um , also , uh , told my friends about this situation and , uh , also , uh , told them to , uh , that I'll be , um , uh , doing plans in future to meet , uh , in that way . Uh , we don't , uh , miss , uh , the personal times that we wanted to , um , um , spend together . Uh , so yeah , that , that's the situation . And , uh , and afterwards , uh , those are the actions I and outcome were really , um , uh , really good because the project that I was doing at work , it was really successful . And at the end of the project , I also went to a restaurant to , uh , um , to meet my friends . And I also told them about my situation and they were really happy that I accomplished a really , um , good thing at my work .",3.333333333,2.333333333,3,3,2.666666667
71,Pwjixjc-6sswi2,". So the work that I currently do now is that of a project manager . I , uh , work with professors , um , and schools to get their , uh , courses online . So , um , my work is always changing and it's very complex because different universities have different specifications and things that they need , um , require , uh , want in a video recording , uh , want processes followed , um , et cetera . So , um , one of the biggest changes that my current position , uh , underwent in the last few years was , uh , switching Jacoby . So , um , switching to working from home recording videos from home , we usually have a studio . So , um , as my job , uh , required , I had to help figure out a way to make these recordings possible from home , um , make these projects continue to get delivered on time and as requested . So , um , I worked with a Paul team to figure out equipment needed , uh , uh , figure out relationships with vendors , uh , discuss with schools what our processes are changing to how we were going to adapt to the changing climate , um , of working from home , recording content from home , um , and essentially come up with a process that , um , did not exist prior and works flawlessly now with the exception of internet issues , which are kind of unavoidable . I'm in working from home , so we've had an insanely good success with a really , really difficult circumstances . And , um , I was one of the four runners , uh , project managers on leading that transition .","For my job , a huge part of it is to set goals for myself , but also mainly for the clients that I work with to deliver their , um , like materials on time . So , um , one of the trickiest ones was one of your own , a very tight timeline , um , for a course . And , um , I worked with the professor and their calendar , which was extremely busy because they were not only doing this project with me , but also being a professor of multiple other courses , um , working with their schedule to map out the timeline for their deliverables , um , that was realistic for them , uh , that allowed us to deliver everything on time . So this involved me working with not only the professor , um , our client , but also , um , different internal teams . So our editing team , our um , build team , um , and communicating with , um , my , uh , superior so they could communicate with the school about our process , our , um , progress , um , on the course and like what our goals were so that everyone was aligned on what we were doing and how we were gonna , um , complete this project . Um , the result , I have never delivered a course late . Um , that course was challenging . Um , it took us all to our limits pretty much in terms of deadlines and , um , stress . Um , but the Stu , the course exists , the students are using it . Um , and it ended in the most satisfactory way that it could have given the circumstances .","I'm in my role making an important decision quickly is something that involves , um , not making a decision at all , but instead decisively deciding how to move forward , um , to choose the best outcome . So , um , recently we were in a meeting with a school who really wanted to do a tech thing that we Are technically able to do but cannot , would not made a policy that we would not do because it was very complicated and time consuming and there was no budget for it . Um , the relationship with the school though was very tenuous . And , um , from our side , the program lead for the school was insistent that we needed to do this thing that they were asking because , um , the relationship management for the school was in jeopardy . Um , but internally our teams are saying this is not something that we could do . So the decision made was we need to circle back with you with this decision , um , to figure out how to best move forward because there wasn't going to be a way in that one moment to make a decision that was going to work for everyone . Um , and the outcome of that was that the partner , the school , um , the director or the program director felt heard and seen . Um , they understood that this was not something that we were offering or could do , but we heard that this was something that they really needed for us to do and that we were going to circle back with our teams and figure out What the best option was to move forward . So making people feel heard and seen and actually acting on those requests and suggestions , um , and enable the relationship to continue in a good way . Even when there was an issue that we were all facing and we were unsure of how to move forward .","As I mentioned , I work with faculty , some of whom are lovely and cooperative and um , on time with things and um , you know , just in general , really wonderful people to work with . Um , but sometimes faculty are stressed out . Um , they are working with me kind of under duress . They don't want to be doing what they're doing , but they have to from , um , their leadership from the school , they're being told that they have to do this thing . So , um , relationship management with those faculty is tricky . It's challenging . Um , so my most recent experience with this was with a um , man who , uh , joined a call with me . They were going to record some content . He was very clearly unhappy , um , and was not being direct with that unhappiness . He was , um , being passive aggressive and snippy and um , just like rude , really . Um , so my experience with this in the past , um , led to me getting just stressed out myself , like internalizing the stress , not saying it out loud , but feeling really on edge and uncomfortable . And ultimately then , then , well , for anyone , but in this instance , like learning from this job , I confronted it , but it didn't a pleasant , straightforward way , um , because this person was not responding to niceties . So I was like , I said to the professor , like , I'm sensing that you're feeling really upset , um , really stressed . Um , just from , uh , the way I'm hearing you say things like , is that , am I reading that right ? Is there something that I can do to make this easier for you and to help us get this done ? Um , and his attitude just shifted , um , immediately because I think he felt , you know , heard and seen and I'm able to recognize that I was feeling that as well . Uh , and it ended up that he was like , Oh , I thank you for asking . No , I'm fine . And just the tone shifted . The recording , the call went well . Um , and everyone left , if not happy , but completed with the project and in a much less passive aggressive way .","I don't think that this is exactly what you're asking , but , um , my work recently has been super busy . Um , but before that it was pretty slow . So I started volunteering for this organization , um , that I'm really happy to be involved with . But , um , when I joined , uh , I was given like a set of , you know , things to do . Um , and you know , volunteering for an organization unfortunately is typically pretty unorganized . Um , so they wanted me to help them figure out what needed to be prioritized for volunteers to work on and like how to give them those assignments . Um , so that was my task . And then at work things got really , really busy and I was unable to prioritize , uh , this volunteer commitment that I've made . Um , so really what I did was to keep in contact with the volunteer coordinator , um , and explain like things are really busy at work . Um , unfortunately I can't do what you've asked of me . Um , I'm making slow progress on certain things , but , um , it's not going to be on the timeline that we were hoping . Um , and just the communication I think really , um , is what's important , especially in a volunteer capacity because everyone's volunteering the person that was reporting to as volunteering . Um , they understand that , you know , work , um , paid things , other priorities . You know , sometimes I have to come first . So , um , the result being that I'm still in progress on those volunteer things . Um , they are not done , but everyone's on the same page about where we are in terms of progress and hopefully our goal . And , uh , we're just in constant communication about how that's going .",3.666666667,3,2.666666667,3,2.666666667
72,Pzrnk7p-fsyfix,"One time that I had to adapt to a changing environment at work or a complex environment was when our building was shut down for renovations and we had to work from home . Mmm , okay . That was a very complex environment because nobody had done it before and we weren't sure how it worked with our servers and if everybody would have the right equipment to achieve this outcome , We okay . Made sure everybody had laptops they bore from home and everybody was connected to the same system so that we all worked together and we had a tech manager and we made sure that we were all working together and I also helped coordinate this change as well .","One goal that I set for myself for a recent project was to have it done before the deadline . And that was very hard to do because it was only myself working on it . Um , in order to do this , I made sure that everything was lined up before that project even got started so that I didn't have to run around and looking , look for all the materials that I would need . So the day that the project started , I was able to hit the ground running and didn't have any delays and was able to start working on it right away and I knew exactly what to do because I took the time beforehand to get that done . Um , the result was that the project was turned in before the deadline , and I was given some parades , which was also pretty nice .","One situation and when I had to make a decision quickly was when we had a vendor that needed to be paid before we could go ahead with the meeting . We had schedule . Um , they had said that they weren't paid and people on our end were saying that they were paid . So we had conflicting information from multiple sources . Um , my action was to just to make sure that we had the right check number and that it cleared the bank and it was paid . And then I sent to the vendor confirmation and they confirmed that they have received it . And then that was the end of the problem . Um , but it all had to be done very quickly . And also I couldn't take anybody . It's word at face value . I just had to do the work and look it up myself .","One of the most high pressure situations was in college at the end of the year when I had to complete my capstone project . Um , this was a situation in which I had to do a ton of research for a legal project , even though there wasn't a lot to go on . Um , what I ended up doing was I started asking , um , other students and people that had done the project before , how they went about it . And I kind of got advice from them and found some resources to go with . And so that was my approach and the outcome was I was able to kind of find where I wanted to get started on it and was able to finish it and not get too off track .","One of the hardest recent commitments to keep because of priorities at work was keeping a medical appointment . Uh , just because the medical appointments were only basically available in the middle of the day when I would be working and usually work would take priority over that . Um , so that was a commitment that's very hard to keep . My action in that case was I asked to take a day off of work and planned ahead and made sure somebody could fill my role for that day . And then I took the day to go and complete the medical appointment and the outcome was I got everything checked up and wouldn't have to go back for maybe another six months or a year , in which case I would just find somebody to take over for me that day .",2.666666667,2,1.666666667,2,2
73,Pe43qg8-edwf28,"Through all of my past work experience , I've constantly had to adapt to a changing and complex environment at work . That's due to the fact that I have been a traveling therapist . So I'm constantly going to new locations , different settings , working with a really diverse , um , array of people and clients and coworkers . Um , some constantly adapting to that environment . Um , being able to collaborate and work as part of an interdisciplinary team , um , to achieve our outcomes for our clients . And also being able to take on clients perspectives that come from diverse backgrounds and being able to work and tile that together .","For my line of work , I'm constantly studying , um , broad goals , um , for my clients . Um , and these goals are sometimes meant to be achieved within a year timeframe . Um , so sometimes these goals are not , um , I guess it's not able to , they're not able to be seen within like a short timeframe . So what we do is we break up those goals into smaller , more achievable steps , um , and we wait until those clients master those small steps to eventually , hopefully master that entire broad goal . Um , all my clients , like I said earlier , are different as diverse . So sometimes these goals , um , are harder to achieve and harder to take data on . Um , but I would say breaking them into smaller steps and also working as part of an integrated interdisciplinary team are the main ways we get those achievements .","One of the blessings and curses I guess , of work having worked in an education setting is having multiple different bosses and different people on the administrative side that have different opinions and different procedures for how they think things should be best done . So sometimes we're faced with conflicting information from , um , our bosses from What they think are procedural . Um , skill should be basically , um , to meet our goals . So many times , at the end of the day , it's up to our own professional judgment and using evidence based practices to make sure , um , those goals are achieved despite having conflicting information sources .","So through my line of work , especially in the school system , I've had many pressured and stressful experiences and situations . I'm just working as part of like that interdisciplinary team and working with families that are sometimes , I guess a little fearful or stressed out . Um , so one case in particular that I'm thinking of , um , a mother wanted all kinds of services at the school for her kid , but the kid just didn't qualify for the services based on the standards set forth by the district . So it was my responsibility to kind of relay that information to her and , um , comfort her in a way where she felt like she was listened to and respected , but also at the same time being firm enough , um , to demonstrate and show that her child just didn't meet the qualifications , um , for the services that she was wanting to get . Um , in the end , we all came to an agreement and she ended up liking me enough to want to work with me , um , in the future with her other son . So .","One of the , uh , I'm not sure if it was really a commitment that I made , but I had been working with a , another therapist and we were working as part of like an interdisciplinary group . Um , unfortunately my case load became so large and extreme that I couldn't continue to participate in that capacity with the group . Um , so I just had to be honest and explain the situation and my reasonings for not being able to participate . Um , fortunately that therapist was very understanding cause they understand how large our case loads can sometimes get . Um , so I basically , without working with them directly , I indirectly continue to supply them with resources , um , and best evidence based practices to help them with their , uh , goals with the group .",3,2,2.333333333,3,2.666666667
74,Pcb776e-hh237h,"Well . Mmm . A time where I had to adapt . It's a complex environment . It would have to be when Kobe kid , it was something that the world now therefore witnessed before . And my job as a probation officer , I have the high risk caseload so I have to make contact with my probation just even though I was allowed to work , come home , I still had to make some type of physical eye to eye contact . So what I started doing was even though we can actually meet in person , we met in the parking lot , I would get in a company vehicle and they would be in their vehicle and they will pull next to my vehicle and we will have an office visit there . They way I was still having contact with them and also I was still able to kind of like regular basis like drug tests and all of that because instead of the , your analysis we used to give in office , we went to great testing . So it was basically virtually no contact . But like I said before , that was something that we've never experienced before , but I was still able to achieve my job .","When I worked at the County jail , I had the task of making sure that the shift was ready for it inspections . So I would , um , we had a list of things we had to do and we had a small amount of time to get it done . Aye delegated different tasks to different people on my shelf . So at the end we were all successful .","When I was working as a jailer on shift , and I wasn't a supervisor at the time . Um , we had an inmate to escape . Well , my supervisor was looking for the inmate . I made a decision . I had to run the jail basically by myself . So I had to make a decision to take the steps to make sure the whole facility was secure . So I took lead as a supervisor because my supervisor was out looking for the actual escape inmate . So I instructed the other jailers under me what to do . We locked down the facility , began a facility count , and make sure everybody else was present . And the outcome was great . Um , the inmate was gay , he was captured and no one was hurt and the facility was secure . And so it was the neighborhood because of it .","Again , it would have to be when I was going to school to get my master's degree . I had a small child at home most of the time . Um , I hadn't taken my mother to her on this , which was like an hour away , and I had to work the night shift . So basically what I would do , I would , um , during a day , my daughter would go to daycare and I would take my mom to her doctor's appointments . Then , um , when I would come home , I was sleep for a couple hours . I would go to work while I was at work . When I got up break or something . Every time I would work on my assignments because I was going to school online . Mmm . And basically it all worked out . It was a stressful situation , but I handled it I to rise everything , even though I may not have had the sleep that I wanted , but I still succeeded . I have . And that's just passive .","My niece had a wedding and I was playing to the end of the wedding , but something came up at work and I had to work on that weekend , so therefore I was unable to , that's in her wit and work always come first , so I knew I couldn't make it that day her , but I made it up on another day .

75,Pyqmytv-efxpra,"So a time whereby I had to adapt to an ever complex environment was when , um , I think complex environments are first and foremost when it doesn't only involve yourself but also involves others . And if others timelines do not essentially mesh with yours in a way that is , um , that's , um , an alignment . And you also ultimately have to navigate those , um , those reasons in a , in a , in a way that would have a beneficial outcome for both parties . So for example , I was on leading the pitch deck and we had to put a team in place in order to proceed with the pitch deck in a more professional manner . Um , however , um , this teammate did not , was not transparent with me and , um , in lacked collaboration , even though I told him multiple times , can you please upload this so we can have him more be , have it more , be more collaborative . Um , after that , uh , quite some time I realized he myself that I do need to have a one on one conversation about any extreme external circumstances that this person might be going through . And with that , I was able to get ourselves to a place whereby , um , the person was able to understand my concerns and I was able to understand their perspective as well , and we were able to come to a successful outcome as opposed to them , um , probably , um , leaving because they were stressed out due to , um , something external , um , apart from the project . So yeah , I would describe that as the time whereby , um , complex as it , and I had to navigate people's concerns and also feelings .","A time whereby I cycles that was hard to achieve was due to external circumstances . I was in Dallas conducting market research and then a tornado happen , which ultimately blew out the power . Um , so I was enabled to proceed with interviewing people within the store as it was ultimately unsafe , not only for the workers and in myself and also for people who might be coming in and out the store . So do this summer project was interrupted in regards to the specific target and the um , and the consumer population that we wanted to meet . However , I took it upon myself and relate to my colleague that we nevertheless need to meet this quota even though we only have a week's time span here before relief . I suggested that we come in early and also late and also make sure we're in this war at key critical times has the previous day I noticed that it was during lunch that a lot of participants or prospective participants would come and go . So to ensure that we would actually skip her lunch and have it at a later time as well so we can get to the quota . And try to do this on every success a day until we finish that . So even though this was quite an aggressive target , you can never know in these circumstances as , of course , you cannot control for how many people come and go . But regardless , I was able to come up with a plan and built upon credible knowledge of what I discerned the environment to be and have the successful outcome by even exceeding our targets in my , which we probably would have never have done had it not been for that power outage .","A time whereby I had to come to an important decision quickly was due to , um , kind of discerning my team and whether or not I should , um , fire them . There was conflicting sources in regards to how my team , how this particular team member interacted with one another and on the community to communicate external circumstances that I brought on with the control that will re unable for them to complete their work . However , um , when they were unable to complete the deadline . Um , again and again , after giving them more than one opportunity to show themselves and even myself providing guidance and any additional help they may need to during this stressful time for them , potentially , they still never lost Rowan unable to complete the deliverable . So I had to make the important decision quickly to let him go as I receive feedback from other team members . And , um , this particular individual was actually disrupting the morale of the team as well because when they see that other people are not completing the work , um , it disrupts not only that particular deliverable but into the deliverables across the organization as well .","Uh , stressful and or , uh , I'll , uh , high pressure situation that I encountered at school or a ramp was often when I would have , um , competing priorities myself for example , I guess in the workplace , um , quite recently up and working two jobs , one that's kind of 12 hours ahead of us and one gutsy within the Eastern time . So , but sometimes the two times zones do overlap . And for this one particular job I had , um , the deliverables would often be daily . So I would have to coordinate not only independently but also with the teammate from the other time zone to ensure that , um , that this project was completed in an in , in an appropriate manner as often . Um , for example , I would receive a list and B and the partner would need it the day of , in a few hours , even though it's only half that I would need to work quite diligently , even though I would have other priorities from my other , um , job as well that I would need to complete just a few hours after . But , um , in regards to that , I would simply ask myself , what's the higher priority one task ? I can knock out right away and which ones I want you to do further on , um , during the day to ensure that both get completed . And the outcome in regards to that was that I was able to complete the task in the way that the PR partner wanted it to be and also have my task done , um , for the other job since there was no loose ends and in respect to that manner as well .","A time whereby I would have , um , difficulties keeping a commitment . I work would often be due to competing meetings alongside the additional work or independent work that I need to complete . Um , concurrently . However , I'm , when I'm unable to attend a meeting , I will ultimately delegate it to another manager and really my constraints to my team . So I built a complete my work independently and oftentimes meetings can take a long time as often a lot of people may need to speak . So I always ensure that , um , the , the meetings are not only efficient , um , respected to what the team has to know , but also in regards to , um , them getting back to their work afterwards . So I did have difficulties trying to keep up with the meetings , but when I sought out delegation , I was able to complete both of them in a manner that is up to par with the professional standards of my organization .",4,4,3.333333333,2.666666667,2.666666667
76,Ptshfi4-fh47sn,"In my current role as an RFP coordinator , I'm required to gain and maintain a large breadth of knowledge for both my team and other teams who may need to use our information as a resource . Our company right now is actually going through a large wholesale change of one of our bread and butter platforms that is powering almost every product that we sell and this is a great , amazing new direction to go in , but at the same time it's bringing a lot of challenges for my team because we have to navigate this water of what do we currently have on file , what is going to be changing . We have to actively reach out to a lot of subject matter experts across the company because we're not being proactively fed the information we have to seek it out ourselves and sort of analyzing what things in our information repository need to be updated for this new interface and when we can use those pieces of information because it is a staggered rollout as well . It's requiring a good amount of adaptation on my team . I am a bit of a product expert on this change and I'm having to communicate a lot of these changes to our team members . Maintaining dual sources of information for both our classic user experience and our new user experience . And it's required a good amount of extra effort coordinating with subject matter experts , as I mentioned earlier , and just being , having to be really proactive about seeking out these changes , ensuring that our customers are getting the accurate information or clearly understand what is going to be available to them at what point and this wholesale change of our platform . It's , it's something that we are having to adapt our process to and it's exciting . Um , it's been a bit of a challenge but ready to take it on and eventually we'll be fully migrated and the groundwork that we've laid now , uh , setting our information sources up and , and seeking out this information is going to be a huge help later on .","Being a member of an RFP team often means that your project goals for completing a project and to end are externally driven . And this can sometimes lead to challenging timelines . We have a large process that we have to go through and depending on the complexity of the bid , these can take weeks to complete . And recently we had a very challenging bid that we had to write , which was probably the largest bid that I've had to work on in my two and a half years on this team . And we were only given the short month of February to complete it when we were , had been expecting , um , a couple of months now . This was a project was hard to complete both because of the scale and the complexity and to address each of those components really ended up resulting in just working longer hours and having to loop in other members of our team as needed . The complexity aspect was where I was left working longer hours to work through the problems , lay the groundwork to eventually rope in other members of our team and to get our project completed on time in full . It did mean that , um , I had to , with my coworker on this project , we set up a work plan to have other members of our team step in and complete some of the , you know , more repetitive tasks involved . We had to fill out hundreds of forms with a lot of the same information . So we had to lay this groundwork , set this framework , and then assign forms to different members of our team who weren't directly related in the project , but we needed the extra manpower . So that was how we , those are the actions we took to help address that challenge of , of a large workload in a very small timeframe and landed up getting it done thanks to the help of our team members . Great . Very grateful for that . Um , yeah . Challenge . But , but overcame it .","One of my key responsibilities as a member of my current team is to maintain what we call our repository , which is a system of one note notebooks . Each product that we offer as a different notebook , we have a whole architecture laid out with tabs and pages to help us store questions that answers so that we can use them when these questions and answers are asked again , but what can sometimes happen is because we have multiple notebooks , you might have one person working on a bid , they asked , they're asked this question , they go for an update , they get an update and they update it in one location in the notebooks and not in another where it also might , where the old response might live and it has happened before where we are sent a list of questions from sales . You had a back end of day rush , rush , rush , and you go and you look for the answer and the notebooks and two different conflicting sources of information pop up and it can mean first of all checking with the team who last updated this response . Sometimes we can see which one is more recent , but if that information didn't translate well , we might also have to reach out to the appropriate SME in the company and we normally keep that marked down . Otherwise we might have to reach out to multiple teams to finally be guided to the right person . And it is important that we get the correct information back to our customers . We wouldn't want to make false promises or give incorrect information . So it's important that we get the get the right response in there . And obviously when we do get the definitive correct answer , it's important that we go in either correct it in the other location or completely strip it out and just link it back to the source of truth to reduce that problem in the future . And then try to keep the team updated when you make changes . That's the thing that we do to mitigate that problem . And it definitely , it helps in the future when we , when we follow that process .","I am a person who strives to always do the absolute best that I can . When I graduated high school , I had a 4.1 waited and when I graduated college I was valedictorian with a 4.0 in English , which some might say is a little trickier because it's so subjective , but something that I'm very proud of . However , in my senior spring semester I was faced with a very stressful , um , high pressure situation . At the time I had been pursuing a dual degree in English and secondary education and I was starting my teaching practicum in which I would actually be in the classroom working full time as a student teacher rather than taking classes . And when I began the practicum , I realized it really was not at all what I thought it was going to be . And I realized that I would be subjecting myself to examinations and rubrics and curricula guidelines that I was not going to be able to meet a hundred percent at the time . I also had a 4.0 and internally that was something I was very proud of and I didn't want to lose my 4.0 also I didn't want to be roped into doing something for the rest of my life that I didn't want to do . And so I was stuck with this big decision . Do I drop the practicum , lose my double degree , but preserve my 4.0 and do something that I want to do in my final semester of college or stick with the practicum , get the double degree . And I sought the advice of family and friends of course . And I ended up deciding to drop the practicum and I had to make this decision quickly because open enrollment for classes was only lasting through the end of the week . This , that I decided to make this decision . And so it was , it was a high pressure situation having to make this life decision in such a short amount of time . But in the end I was happy that I did . So I quite enjoyed the classes that I took , especially Chaucer and lots of evolution of English . That's personal preference . A personal passion of mine is language , and I ended up , as I said earlier , graduating valedictorian of my class and you know , at the expense of my double degree that I probably wouldn't have ended up using anyway . I think it's worked out . I have , you know , gained great working experience in an industry sector that I much prefer . So it was all , it was all worth it in the end .","In addition to my primary responsibilities , which are to manage the RFP workflow . I am also the liaison for our large customer marketing program in which we actively reach out to our largest statewide customers . We have high contract value deals with and offer them free promotional materials and just generally check in and see how things are going , how their usage is from their patrons . And each fiscal year the members of this large customer marketing program get assigned sites to actively outreach to , and this past fiscal year I was assigned to five sites and other members of the team . It was kind of a higher amount other members of the team , one to three customers . And it reached a point where my RFP workload was becoming a lot and that is my primary responsibility . So I needed to focus on those and I realized that I was not going to be able to deliver the level of customer care that I wanted to and that I think that our companies should be delivering to the large customers that I was assigned to . So I ended up reaching out to other members of the large customer marketing team , asking them if they would be able to offload a couple of the sites so that those sites would receive the attention that they needed . While I was focusing on my primary role in the RFP team , and it ended up being good for everybody . Um , I felt less stressed by the workload that I had to deal with and the customers received the attention that they deserve as our large customers . And it , it was , it was good . It was , um , you know , difficult for me to feel like I needed to ask for help . But I did , and I think it , it was , it was again , worthwhile in the end .",4.333333333,3.666666667,4,3,4
77,P6y7z4z-a4sing,"In my current position , uh , we are asked to coordinate that with the government who are our sponsors , uh , in order to provide monthly updates , uh , for them in the form of what we call PMR meetings . Uh , I was tasked not only with rebranding the , uh , paperwork for these meetings as well as the PowerPoint slides , uh , but also with reformatting the meetings to give them more interesting graphics . I did in fact submit graphics for all of the metrics that we , uh , described to our government counterparts in these PMR meetings . However , uh , it transpired that the government did not in fact want the updates that my , uh , supervisor had first , uh , assigned to me . Therefore , I was tasked with going back into the , uh , PMR materials and updating the old graphics and , uh , charts to make them more readable , uh , more consistent with our company's branding , but without altering the format too much as the government was content with the format that we currently have them in , uh , through a combination of trial and error , as well as sticking with the format that they originally wanted , but updating it to look cleaner . And again , more in touch with our company branding , I was able to find a middle ground that suited both parties .","As technical writer . In my current position , I have been tasked with rebranding several documents due to the fact that our company has taken over a contract from a previous company . Uh , one of these documents I was tasked with rebranding was a long document over 100 pages and they needed it by the beginning of the next week . It was given to me very late in the week . So due to the fact that I knew that time was pressing , I knew that we were being judged against the behavior of our , of the previous contract holder and the fact that I wanted to make a good impression as I hadn't been in the position very long , I took it upon myself to work extra hours to finish this material , uh , as it was the end of the pay period , I was unable to , uh , make up the hours for myself . However , it did reflect well for me , uh , to my supervisors and to the government . And they did specify that they were appreciative of my personal sacrifice and that they would not be willing to ask me , uh , to do so in the future . Although I do feel that I would be willing to , should the situation warranted .","In my current position , I work with a second technical writer who is often on , uh , a different project than I am . Uh , at one point she was unable to do her specific monthly meetings that are transmitted to the government , uh , as far as , uh , typing them up and transcribing them , and she asked me to cover her meetings that month . Uh , I was not sure , uh , if in transcribing them I had aired , uh , insofar as giving too much information or information or unnecessary information , um , unfortunately she was unable to be asked . Therefore , knowing that I had to send the document out on that timeline , I included all information that I thought was relevant , um , under the assumption that , uh , it would be better to have more information than needed , uh , than less . Uh , in the end , I was able to contact her supervisor afterwards to ask how it had been received and was praised for the initiative of providing the extra information .","I had my previous position , I was a data librarian . It was responsible for the flow of data from the original test reception to the , uh , data processors . I was the one who , uh , categorized it , scan it into the computer and gave permissions as to who and who could not access it . Uh , I often had backups of at least two to three people . However , at one point , shortages led to , uh , myself being the only point of access for this flow of data . Uh , at one point during this time we had a large influx of data over 160 different , uh , files , uh , in varying sizes . Uh , come in during one day I formatted a assembly line technique to , uh , process these files as quickly as possible , accounting for size . And with this was able to get through the majority of these files with very little interruption in the process .","At my current position , I'm responsible as technical writer for , uh , transcribing and maintaining minutes for all the daily meetings that we hold before our team and our organization as a whole . These meetings not only give all of our team members something to look back at should they need a reference , but they also help team members who may be , uh , out of the office or on vacation , uh , keep up with current daily activities . Uh , unfortunately I do have some commitments to supersede these minutes when they are to be submitted on a timeline . For example , if I am tasked with rebranding or editing a product , uh , that has a timeline of the next 24 hours , I will prioritize that over the daily minutes and will not come back to the minutes for that specific day as if I did . It would create a cascading backlog . Therefore , I focus on the minutes for the next day and as I do record every meeting , keep the recorded meeting that was not transcribed in backlog so that team members can refer to it if they need .",3,3.333333333,3,2.666666667,3
78,Puwy4cq-ctz8tp,"Uh , most recently , uh , for a complex challenge that I had to adapt to a work cause we had a major change in management to , um , work in a government office . It's a pointed position and the senior management was all switched out , uh , not after an election . But after , uh , one of the older , uh , directors retired , uh , this caused a new person to move into the position . That position requires that they have a very specialized degree and they had a totally different way of doing things , a totally different management style . Um , they very much wanted to be progressive and , uh , respond quickly , uh , and uh , make us more of a , an adaptive organization as opposed to kind of a passive organization . Um , so I kind of took it on myself to help spearhead that effort . Uh , we just really tried to , pardon the phrase , to think out of the box . We brainstormed with everybody from top management down to the frontline service people . Uh , we brought in suggestions of how every aspect of the project could be done and how it could be done better . And some of our best advice came from , you know , unexpected places , you know , whether this be like our front end poked facing provider or somebody back more in the , uh , the tech sector . Um , all those things together . Uh , you know , really created a great environment so people felt comfortable discussing things . And I really , I really tried to lead those meetings and I managed my teams so that they felt comfortable discussing whatever ideas they had . Even if it was so off the wall , like we would give it a try , we'd think it out . Sometimes those ideas evolved in the better ideas and uh , just being open , open to any kind of option and then try to be creative also makes it really fun to be that way . So creating a work , work friendly environment where people aren't afraid to say things and to try new things . Um , you know , especially when things are complex and especially during a lot of changes . I think it was just the best environment you can come up with and , uh , gets the best results in the end . And even if you don't get the best results in it , it's not working quite right . You just go back and you do it again , and you continue to evolve to try to be better . They're not all home runs , but in the end you usually end up winning the game .","Well , the last big project I did as a project manager was a accreditation process and it was real complex . There were hundreds of different standards that we had to meet . And so , um , this was a big , big project . We knew it was going to take about a year and we decided to approach it really methodolic mythologically as possible . Um , you know , first off , uh , we came up with a plan like number one we've set out , we're going to approach it and we'd send a break it into parts that made sense . And then from there we actually got the whole team together and we broke those parts out that needed to get done as far as like meeting different standards amongst the people who were best suited to find the answers to those standards or at least develop them . So it kind of broke it out by specialty . Um , put those all in , uh , let them go . Uh , people would come back with their feedback , we'd review it as a group . Sometimes we get input from other groups and you know , my , uh , open some eyes up about like , well one , one part of the , uh , of the group is affecting the other and then maybe tweak those policies and procedures a little bit and uh , you end up having to open up better , better policy at the end of it . Uh , some of the parts that were a little hard to tackle , you know , we kinda went from the low hanging fruit first , but uh , some things were more difficult and you know , this to maybe a single group isn't able to come up with great answer . And so those we would bring back after we've kind of got all those easy , easy points and lowering leg hanging fruit , like I said , done . Um , we went back and just started systematically worked through the more difficult things . And in the , in that case , the best that you can handle is a bunch of people looking at it from a bunch of different perspectives . And that took a few months to chip through , just kind of taking them on one at a time . And then once we kind of had all of our theme , all the parts assembled , then again , it broke down into like how we're going to reorganize and how we're going to present it . Um , and then put the whole package together again . We just kind of did pretty much like specific committee assignments . And then once each person had their section done , uh , that was all compiled . And then we all reviewed it for a final checkoff . And then , uh , I did the final , final sign off . But definitely a team approach .","Well , certainly , you know , like in this industry , um , we don't have all the information and we sometimes have to make up a best guess on what to do based on the information that we do have . Uh , so you know , what I do is I'll pull the team together . Um , everyone will kind of do a brief review of like how we see the situation . Um , and then we might do a , uh , a problem identification process . We'll figure out what our biggest issues are and then we'll the group kind of brainstorm some of those solutions . Um , then we'll bring it down back down to the individual problems and then we'll look at the solutions and then we'll kind of go through each one of those solutions . Uh , kind of it a ranking of how probable it is that we can actually complish that task as well as identifying both the positives that might come with that . And of course , all the other negatives and challenges and we don't make any decisions until we've done them all . And usually the best course of action will emerge pretty quickly . This can be done in a pretty fast process . I think it's really important to involve a lot of team members because you know , you don't know where the hiccups are going to be in the chain . And if everyone's got a say into it , or at least they can see like the plan that's being developed , you know , you're not able to respond very quickly .","The last high pressure situation I had in the workplace as I had an employee who was a definitely a very good friend of mine as well , uh , and up of being accused of a theft , um , just terrible , you know , really hard . Uh , you know , drinking , you feel feel forum , but you know , it's in the end it's like you kind of have to make sure that you're protecting the interests of the company . Uh , so that being the case , um , we went ahead and we launched an independent investigation . Uh , we looked into it , we interviewed them , interviewed other people , the other witnesses , uh , look for physical data that either exonerate or , or show that , uh , maybe there was something nefarious going on there . And once we had all that information together , we wouldn't have confronted the employee and asked if they had an explanation for why this might've been happening or why they would have done this . Uh , just to give them a chance to maybe explain that they had a logical reason for what they did or also a chance to fess up beforehand . And so that was really difficult . But , uh , you know , when , when it's a hard situation like that , a lot of times you just kind of fall back on the policy and procedure and you can just kind of have to do it by the book . And in the end we had to let them go . Very , very difficult for a personal perspective . But , uh , very easiest from a management perspective .","Well , certainly as you know , in this industry , um , my industry , um , our industry , uh , you know , it's a rapidly changing environment and so we're responding to one crisis . And then even if you're already kind of focused on that and a second crisis , uh , comes up , that's even bigger . Sometimes you just have to triage the , and so sometimes you have to bump things out of order . You're able to take care of the big fires first and then go back and put out the small fires . Um , you know , but all this is really comes down to is just , just communication . Um , you've got to do what you can do , the amount of time , short amount of time to make the biggest punch . Uh , if that means like some things get pushed to the side , um , for at least temporarily , uh , sometimes you have to do it . As long as you're communicating with the client , explaining what's happening . 99% of the time they're gonna understand . Um , everybody knows that the workplace is today anymore . You know , very rapidly changing environments and , uh , the ability to adapt . Uh , anyone who's in business is going to understand that . Like , sometimes , sometimes you just got to like , do things that aren't the traditional , uh , you know , customer comes first type approach .",4.333333333,3.5,3,3.333333333,3
79,P9ycjn7-3va6qd,"So for me , that was during . Um , I had to make sure I had my team ready to work online for me . Like I work online and I work from home and I worked pretty much everywhere I go . So it was pretty simple . But like there's a lot of team members who were worried about doing everything online just because they didn't feel they had the proper equipment , the internet speed . So we as a company had to make sure that they were ready to roll , ready to do it . And um , so that was a challenge just because we didn't originally had a plan to work online , obviously . Like that just changed the way a lot of people did business . And ultimately that has changed the way we're going to do business going forward . So as a team , we did a really good job of making sure our team was ready to roll and work online .","So this also kind of leads back to Kobe . I wouldn't say we set goals as far as like numbers go , but like we want to challenge our team to be the best they could be working online . Because to me when you work online , it is 10 times more challenging than just working at home . Like you have to be at the top of your game , you have to be focused , you have to be ready to handle clients who are using a lot of apps to work , like talk online . So they are very , they're nipping at the bit . So like we just had , we set a goal to just be more efficient , like with everything . And that was , it was definitely a challenge because like I said in the last question , we had never planned to just go fully online , but it happened .","When doesn't that happen ? That happens every day at work . Like I always feel like I'm being pulled like so many different ways . But recently we had a client who upper management told me they were looking for one thing , and then an advisor who had worked with them told me they were looking for another thing , and I was getting pulled into working with this client . So I had to basically , I just broke it down and said , I'm being told you're looking for two different things . So I made it a point to really find out what this client wanted , what they needed , what would help them reach their goals . So I was able to break down what they wanted , what they needed out of our services , and we came to an awesome agreement and it worked out amazing .","Once again , when it comes to work , when isn't it high pressure ? Um , just working in the finance field , like it's always just timelines when you're dealing with people in their money . Like they're just not , it's not easy . But , um , I'll use an example from school . It was my senior year and I was chosen to lead a group project in one of my courses just because like , I'm usually the one that's pretty outgoing and , um , I like to take the lead . So what made it really challenging is we had a couple people in our group who had that senior IDAs and they just didn't want to do anything . Um , but ultimately I , I sat the role , so I made it , I guess more simple for them to find something that they were good at to help the team . And ultimately we did a great job and we got an all got A's and everyone in the group left happy .","This happens all the time . Honestly . Um , I found my family taking a backseat when it comes to work , which that's something if I'm being completely honest with you , I want to change as I move forward in this career , like into a new career . I want that work life balance . But just in general , like I find myself like having to work weekends , missing nieces and nephews , like soccer games , sometimes birthdays . And that's something I'm like , I've taken a look in the mirror and like I don't want to do that anymore . Like I want to have a career where I have that balance and I can be there on the weekends and I'm not pulled in both directions because I believe when you work 40 45 hours during the week , you can get done what you need to get done . And I know some employers don't necessarily like that answer , but like it's an honest answer .",3,1.5,2.333333333,2,1.333333333
80,Pfceifd-ezhkz6,"Hi there . Nice to see everyone from a standing point of view last time , I'm not sure if everyone remembers , but I was taking this interview recorded from the comfort of my bed because I had just had back surgery . I'm on day 10 post-ops so I'm feeling good walking around . I have some hiking poles to get around the house . So I am feeling great and I appreciate the continued opportunity to be here with you folks and continue my interview . So I've been asked to describe a time they had to adapt to a change your complex environment . So in the healthcare setting in which I work my environment and change quite rapidly due to for a period of about eight months or so , we were without a senior management level . I am still a mid level manager and what that meant was there was no communication between our mid level management team and our executives kind of above us at the top . So I took it upon myself to coordinate with my other colleagues in the same role as me working with different groups of people to have biweekly meetings to catch up on things . Have open forms of communication across the board with both my mid level management teams and our executives because there was a big issue of communication and no one really knew what was going on where when there's such a divide between groups of working kind of tears in our specific facility . So I was the interim essentially senior management level where I was overseeing not only my group of staff directly but also working together with the mid level management as well . So even though it wasn't asked of me , I took it upon myself because I could see that there was a huge disconnect in the communication . Things weren't getting done the way they had typically been and until we had a new senior manager about seven or eight or so months in , I was kind of working as interim as a communication point for both the executives and or mid level management . So I think that was a very complex and difficult time in our workplace where no one was really sure who to go to or really what the environment was going to look like in the coming weeks . And I would say I did a good job being the mediator between both groups , making sure that my staff both knew what they were doing and that the senior executives at the top really understood where we're coming from , what challenges we faced , and the future of our company moving forward .","So I've been asked to describe a time that I set goals for a project that were relatively hard to achieve . The steps I took to reach the goals I had set for myself and for my group , and then the actions they took and the of course the ultimate result . So being the interim manager of multiple groups of managers taken upon myself , of course , I had set a goal of essentially redoing our ordering system within our hospital group . So we didn't really have a good system in place at the time . And losing that upper level management above me was kind of the key issue in getting the resources we needed from a supply standpoint . Of course , we were still functioning to full capacity , even beyond capacity . So knowing that there needed to be a system in place of ordering was vital . I was able to contact an agency who worked specifically on coding and was very familiar with our ordering system and our healthcare system at the time . So we were able to go ahead and analyze what supplies we needed from a consistent basis . I manually went to , had and verified everything without AI help , just by human kind of counting and picking an ex , uh , an Excel spreadsheet . It was great . And then we were able to go ahead and create a system of code and software to make a viable ordering system that our senior management still uses to this day . So I was able to realize the issue that we had , make steps as far as reaching out to a system , developing it , tailoring it to our needs , and then going ahead and training staff to implement that system to be continuously used . Of course , this had to be done also through a proposal to our senior executives to make sure that everything was copacetic and everything was going to move forward as planned . And now proudly I can say that ordering system is used throughout our hospital group and that any type of ordering doesn't have to take as long as it nearly dead . There are far fewer ordering mistakes and mishaps . It's increased the revenue overall of our supply . And in turn , it's made life easier for support staff who utilizes that system every single day . So overall , I would say that that was a great success moving forward . This is the system that we have in place for all our hospital clinic sisters , our sister clinics , I should say . So I couldn't be happier with the outcome . I was able to create a program that worked .","So situation that comes to mind in which I had to make a decision quickly but was faced with conflicting information from multiple sources and what that situation looks like must be the situation in which I discovered that our mid level management , so above me I should say my supervising management was leaving . There were rumors that really no one could verify at the time . So multiple sources were provided information that yes , the upper level management above me were no longer going to be in place . Some people said that that was not possible and essentially what that came down to was making a decision to go ahead and take the bull by the horns and put myself in a position that United both the upper level management as well as my colleagues and that mid level management sort of situation . So even though senior management really didn't know what the situation was going to look like , going ahead , having a plan of action , establishing clear lines of communication between both groups and then following up with the plan was the most important thing . I really emphasize to my colleagues in the mid level management type role that we needed to have a consistent schedule that was not going to be messed . So whether that was my colleagues being in meetings with us be assume or being in meetings with us via person or arranging their own schedules to fit in that open line of communication . It was absolutely vital . So even though truly in the beginning when our upper level management above us in the mid level wasn't really clear whether they were going to be around or not , it really was a kind of split second decision to make . What can I do to make sure that this company thrives and continues and really our operations do not have any sort of hiccup in them . So I'd say even though there were a lot of conflicting sources of information about whether this would come to fruition , I'd have to say that I'm glad that I went with the decision I made , even though it was quick . Even though it might have seen very , very messy initially . I think in the greater scheme of things that it was the right decision to make for both the company , for my personal staff members and for my colleagues alike .","So working in a medical setting and also having to work with different people from different teams on a daily basis and in person over zoom , what have you . I've come across a lot of high pressure , stressful situations in my working career . One that sticks out to me , I think the most would be working in the emergency department at the time where a patient had come in presumably under the influence of some sort of substance or narcotics . We're not sure to this day . And he was very violent and threatening towards the staff and it had come to my attention from a staff member who raised concern that this member had a weapon on them , specifically a gun . So being irate , being very upset , being in a high trust situation , I realized that this person really needed someone to talk to , to be firm with them and to also let them know that what they were doing and how they were acting was inappropriate . So I was able to get this particular person away from the general public . And of course my staff , I was able to isolate them in a room , uh , under which there was direct supervision . The police were involved and were able to handle the situation without any sort of eventful outcome . Luckily , and in the back of my mind , the tech part I always had was the safety of the public who were there at the time with us , as well as my staff members and making sure that there were open lines of communication , of course , not to the public to create a panic , but essentially with my staff members who I felt very confident in because they're very respectful , they're very calm people and they could do things that are very direct manner and talk with this person very directly . So I'm glad that the outcome was that no one was hurt . This person was apprehended . They did ultimately receive medical care . They needed be it not life threatening , but they were there because they needed us . And stress really can do awful things to people . So I don't hold that against them . I'm just happy that this outcome was the way it was and that my staff and the public were not hurt . We're not in harm's way .","So a time that experienced difficulty keeping commitment at work do you each other priorities was the time that a colleague of mine who had just been onboarded a few months prior had asked for a meeting to go over concerns that have been raised by senior management about their performance . So I did my best to keep in constant communication with this gentlemen and unfortunately when the day came that I realized our meeting had been planned and scheduled for lunch , I had to reach out to him and let him know that I was in the midst of still working out the kinks in this ordering system that I've implemented . So unfortunately , even though I had really wanted and had great notes about giving him the feedback that he asked , including what issues I saw and comments about that , I had to let him know , unfortunately at the last minute that this had to be put onto the side for another day another week just because this order and system is vital to the continuance of smooth operation within our clinic and sister clinic . So I let them know via email , Hey , I'm very sorry . I would love to keep this date with you to go over things , but we're going to have to move this meeting to the future . And luckily our schedules lined up the following week , we were able to have a very productive meeting . We were able to go over questions and concerns from either sides , and I am happy to report that six months later , this colleague is no longer under any sort of probationary period . They're thriving . And they really took the comments I had in upper management hat to heart . So even though it was difficult to say no , because I really appreciate when people want my feedback and communicate with me , they completely understood that it was just something that would have to wait to continue their best as they were doing and that we would circle back and really get into detail what needed to be done moving forward . So it's hard for me to say no times , especially when it comes to my feedback . But I'm really happy that things worked out and that this colleague of mine is now writing .",4.333333333,4.666666667,3.666666667,4.333333333,3.333333333
81,Pda5kmv-7bhrmp,"Okay . So I would say a time where I had to adapt to , um , a complex changing environment was when , um , I started off as a project manager , um , some years ago and I was mainly working in the waterfall environment . So the waterfall environment is basically having a step by step procedure and um , you know , like chain as to how you move from one phase of the projects to another and how you deal with it . So that's the kind of mindset that I had . But then early , um , later on around , um , I think it was 2017 , 2018 , the idea of agile started , you know , coming up whereby , um , it involved incremental , incremental steps included in the process of um , you know , the work , the software development . So I found that ended up a bit hard to adapt to that because my mindset was , you know , finish , finish one section and then get some feedback from the client . But in a way I feel , I feel like I was able to adapt to because I'm the kind of person where I'm not closed minded . Even though I was sitting in my ways with a particular way of working . I'm a closed minded person and I will try things and I actually sort of benefit and the value of conducting , um , my work approach in such a way whereby I'm getting constant feedback from the client . So the only downside to this that was challenging is that it made my work a little bit longer in terms of sort of doing the project work itself . I kept on having so many meetings , so many followups , so many minutes to write up . But at the end of the day I thought that it was better because in the long run it kind of guides you as to ultimately what the client wants . And at the end of the day , that's what the project manager is therefore to guide the project so that it can have a successful outcome for the client . Right . So , um , I admit it was a bit challenging because I felt like , okay , everything I had learned , and you know , the way I was working was a set method , but then I had to change it all of a sudden because everyone started to become agile and then I had to get a certification in agile . So the way , like , it just changed my mindset . Like it was a little bit difficult changing my mindset , but I was open to doing it . So I think that's what made me overcome this difficulty at first , you know ? Yeah .","So a time that I will describe was when I was actually coming up in my career as a project manager . So I was a fledgling at this point . And I would say that , um , I was the kind of project manager that when I was doing my estimations for specific tasks for a project , I would port the exact time for , um , the task , right . Maybe just a little bit of leeway , like a buffer , but I'll put the exact time . And the thing is , um , what happened with this is I remember one project I was working on and we were kind of like a close knit team . So the developers there were only about , I think four developers working on a team at the time . And um , coincidentally , you know , three out of them they were sick . So it kind of pushed the project deadline way behind schedule . They were sick for like , I dunno , I think it was about two , two weeks , which was kind of a big hit to the project , right ? Cause I was relying on their expertise and um , to be honest , the kind of company that I worked in , how can I explain this ? It was a , it was a company within a bigger company . So I , I worked for a company that acquired my company that I worked for , but um , we were dealing with different parts of the business . So what I had to do to overcome this situation was that I had to really try and talk to other functional managers outside of the team with outside my company , meaning outside of the team externally and try and persuade , cajole negotiates for two other high school with developers just to do the work . Um , for this project . And I , it was a difficult time because with these functional managers , um , they're mainly focused on operational work and how can I put this politely ? They didn't really care so much about the project cause it's not their project , it was my project , but I really had to persuade and bargain . Right . So I think that kind of tested my negotiations , my negotiation skills at that point in time . But it also taught me a lesson that when I am , um , when I'm certain estimations , I kind of liked to , um , what does it under promise and overachieve . So nowadays what I do is I would add in like more of an extra buffer , not just a little bit of leeway , but more of an extra buffer , like a week or two . So if something's going to take a week to do , I will put it at maybe like two weeks and a couple of days . And that way , um , you set the client's expectations and if you deliver early , which we always end to do them , you know , everyone's happy .","So I had given the go ahead , um , to one of my , uh , several analysts to upgrade a production system from a particular version to another particular version , right . Um , or to the latest version , a higher version . And , um , the thing is it all went , um , bottled up like kits . It was a disaster . And the strangest thing about it was that normally the way I work as a project manager , we kind of test the upgrade out on the testing environment first so that we , we are aware of any issues that may happen before we head to the live environment . Because with the live environment , it takes a lot of organization and planning the , um , clients , the end users of the system , they won't be able to use it for a certain period of time , which that is classified as downtime to them and again , can hit into their budget , can hit into their targets and goals . So , you know , it's all a knock on effect . So during this update , um , with the production system , it all went wrong . Um , and I was on the pressure as to make a decision as to do we investigate this or do we roll back to the old version now ? Um , the reason why it was a difficult position , um , situation was because we had already spent from 12 to three , three hours investigating , right ? And that meant three hours downtime for the client . So I was getting conflicting , conflicting . Um , how can I pull information from different sources ? Like for example , the server department , you know , would say that they think is a schema issue . The database department would say that's all they think . Um , there's an issue with one of the tables not being filled incorrectly within the database . Like it's missing information . So I was getting the same , different people were in different sources and different departments were investigating and I was getting conflicting information . Right ? But , um , so I was just like , Hmm , what should I do because we can't have any more downtime . If we go past four hours , then that is a consequence to us in the contracts . We've stated that we're going to solve any issues within four hours . Right . So , um , I was in a difficult position how I overcame this . I spoke to the client and I told him , you know what ? I gave you these expectations , telling him that we're going to roll back if we're not able to resolve it within the next 30 minutes , given ourselves 30 minutes prefer . Right ? So , um , so the client agreed and said , yeah , I'm willing for you to go extra 30 minutes . So we went with the extra 30 minutes . And , um , we , we just compared the test to the live while the server team did that and they found the issue , although they couldn't explain what happens , but they found the issue and resolved it . And that's what we went with . Um , it was really .","So the difficult , the difficult situation that I faced , um , I would say was that I , uh , recently , um , I , it's to do with work . So professionally I managed to persuade my company to pay for um , a set as a certain um , certification professional certification that I wanted to on the go . It's the PMI risk management professional exam . Right . And I was under a lot of pressure because I didn't attend any classes . I was still working it , there was mayhem at work , different projects , um , just really having issues . So you know , I had to deal with that . I had to deal with self study as well and um , materials getting the right materials , which was a nightmare for the um , for the course that I was doing , the self study , the project risk management because there were conflicting sources of information stating what you had to study cause I didn't actually attend , um , any , any classes . So it was , it was difficult to understand . Um , what syllabus wasn't the old syllabus or the new syllabus was a D the old PIM book guide or the new pin book guide . So that was made him a saw . And then top , um , coupled with that , um , it's not really work related or school related , but you know , being pregnant early in , in my , um , early pregnant , um , trimester first trimester , it was quite difficult to try and find the time to study having a toddler as well . Um , I have another son , he's two years , two years old , right . And , um , migrating to a new country , well I won't really say have migrated to a new country , but it's still fairly new cause I've been here less than a year . Right . So , um , yeah , so all of that together at once was quite difficult . So I knew that at the end of the day what pays the bills , right . My job . So I had to focus on that first , but I knew that my studies were , um , lacking , uh , my attention . So India , at the end of the day , um , I had , I decided to , okay , what I'm going to do is I need to sacrifice sleep . It's only a short time . I know this is going to be over within a month . I had to sacrifice sleep . So I would work during the day study during the nights just for a couple of hours , four hours . And it also adds a sacrifice , my , um , qualities , right ? So I took like every now and again , I will take two days off here , two days of day . I would always get in close to my exam . I took a week off because I couldn't afford to , um , not parks , especially when it's the company that's sponsoring me . Right ? So it was a lot of pressure and also the fact that of morning sickness and um , you know , just being tired all the time and also having to handle my toddler . So I , when I look back on it is a really quick achievement because I passed . Woohoo . I passed there and I'm very proud of myself . Like as a project manager , there will be times where you have to handle immense pressure and just deal with it .","Okay . So , um , I'm currently facing this now as in back to back anyway , uh , in my current role at the moment and what it is , is we're pretty short staff and I feel like when I am , there's one particular client that I'm , I have mine specifically with this analogy and I , based on what I , um , estimates or the information that I get back from my manager and different departments , that's what I base my decisions on . And that's what I base my commitment to this particular client on . Right ? So when I commit to them telling them that , you know , these particular modules or these particular tasks will be implemented into the , um , test system or production system by a certain date , um , I expect that to happen because the client expects it to happen . But , uh , as of , I would say late last year to the first quarter of this year , that hasn't been happening because , um , the company is going through a certain situation right now whereby developers are leaving . Um , and people who are skilled in certain areas , they're either off sick with covert right . Um , or , uh , people can't get into the office because of we had , um , a recent snow storm recently . So just a spin different things that's happened in that basically my commitment to the client is , um , getting affected . So , uh , I think for me , I kind of almost expect this now knowing what's going on in the background . So how I tend to deal with this is my motto is when I meet the client the next time we speak with the next time we have our meeting , not to turn up with nothing . So what I mean by that is at least there's a way to , even though what you've promised , what you've promised them , you don't deliver , you have to come up with the next best thing or something else that would kind of sweeten that disappointment a bit . And that's what I , that's what I tend to do . Cause I didn't think , it's not really like technically it's my fault because I'm the project manager . Whatever happens to the project is , it's my project . But realistically , it's not my fault because I'm not , I can't control the certain aspects of , you know , these extended externalities that are affecting or impeding on my project . So , um , but I just tend to deal with it in a way whereby , okay , if I'm not getting any specific , um , any specific input or any specific , um , deliverables from these other departments , what can I do to , uh , to , to soften the blow . Like , for example , I'm creating a comprehensive manual document as to how to use the system , some sort of training . And that's what I tries to deliver to the client .",3.666666667,3.333333333,3.666666667,4,3.333333333
82,P6qhzqs-48bazs,"Um , so I can remember a time when our sales team was appointed a new VP of sales . It was a huge culture and organizational shock to everyone on the team . Uh , the change was tough at first because this VP seemed to be less experienced . And the person who had previously been in the role overall , it felt like a bad hire , not only to me , but the rest of the group . I decided I were to keep that opinion to myself , although other people told me about theirs . I wanted to get to know this VP and learn about the , her past , her past successes , um , and what she would be able to bring to our organization . Um , I've only in a few months , um , her contribution to the company , um , had been very successful , um , for our research . And my team and I have come to appreciate her insight and perspective , especially since , um , she , she came from a very different environment and a very different work culture .","When I first started out in research , I didn't have a lot of clinical experience or regulatory experience . Um , I thought I could pick it up along the way . But after about a year , I realized I needed to make some changes if I wanted to be able to progress , um , in research . So , um , that's when I decided to , um , start the master's of regular fare regulatory affairs program at the university of Pennsylvania . Um , this type of masters would only take two years to complete . Um , but , uh , I really wanted to get done as soon as possible so I could qualify , um , for a promotion . And I looked at the courses I needed to take and created a detailed schedule , um , Danks to the small goals I created along the way and the schedule that I created . I was able to get my masters in about a year and a half . And with that , I was able to get my promotion . Um , and then I also am now a regulatory specialist in research .","When I worked at the Philadelphia ACE consortium , I was a grant writer . Um , I remember there was this one time where I had a hard deadline , um , to submit , uh , by the end of the day , uh , for a grant application for significant amount of funding . Um , and the nonprofit was in serious need of funding at that time . Um , so I was left , so I was a grant writer . I , I have skill loans and grant writing . I wasn't left just , you know , as this random person to submit . And , um , my boss was , had a family emergency , so he had to fly , um , to Mexico . Um , so I , I worked , um , with him , um , the day before he left to make sure that every piece that we needed where it was , um , was in place . Um , and then he left for his trip , but somehow we both overlooked , um , a huge component . Um , and I wasn't able at that time to , um , communicate with him since he was , he was , um , flying . And so with that , I tried , um , the assistant associate director of the nonprofit , um , who didn't have a lot of grant writing experience . Um , and he was telling me that , you know , I should Really be holding off on submitting until the director was able to , like , I wasn't able to get in contact with the director , but that would have been way after the application was due . So , uh , the information required , uh , that , uh , that , that we missed , that key component , um , was something that I could , um , that I could try to answer by comparing previous applications that I've done in that and my boss has also done . Um , and then , uh , verifying those details with , um , with , um , the public health department . Um , and so I was able to put together the relevant information and made the decision to submit application before the deadline . It was accepted . Um , we won the grant , but it was interesting to see that , um , some people were not comfortable enough to help me gather that information because they thought it was , um , it was just something that the director was able to answer . Not anybody else , but I was able to answer it . Um , you know , with , um , with other stakeholders within , within that , um , grant .","When I first started a new research , um , was very new to the hospital , the university of Pennsylvania . I didn't have a lot of clinical experience yet with patients . Um , so my job was basically in the lab or , um , with sorting binders , funneling filings , things like that . Um , one day one of my coworkers called me and she was like , um , my subject , um , something's wrong with my subject . He's , he's fainting and throwing up . And I was like , Oh , well , like , where , where are you , um , doing the study visit ? And she said , the research center , I said , can you get one of the nurses to call ? Um , rapid response ? And she hung up the phone and she called me back a few minutes later and she's like , nobody will call Rapids response . So I went over to the research center and , um , I noticed that he , you know , this guy was very pale . He couldn't , he couldn't really hold his head up . Um , he wasn't talking , his , his speech was slurring . Um , and I went up to the research nurse and I said , um , you know , this , this guy is not well paying . Can you call rapid response ? And she said , no , we like , he's fine . We don't need to do that . And so I found a wheelchair and I helped my coworker get the subject into the wheelchair and then we wheeled him down to , um , the emergency department . We , we went through the right channels to try to get him a rapid response , but we were calm enough to be able to make sure the patient was , you know , in a wheelchair , find the wheelchair and the wheelchair and then roll to the ed . Um , the patient act , the subject actually had a stroke . Um , and luckily we were able to get him to the ed , um , being like calming , um , not panicking . Uh , later we , um , had a conversation with the research center saying that , you know , they have a responsibility to call a rapid response specialist since they're nurses and they're able to , you know , a nurse practitioner . So they're able to assess , um , the , the patient , um , and the patient's wellbeing . Um , but that will come as good . The patient recovered , luckily recovered . He had no damage to , um , you know , his Mo mobility or his speech . So , um , it was good , but it was definitely a high and a stressful situation . Especially being new , especially now , um , not , not knowing exactly what to do in that situation .","So this is actually something that happens quite frequently in my job . Um , I am a regulatory specialist and I'm given very strict deadlines for submissions , um , as well as , um , preparing , um , different submissions so that other submissions are submitted on time . However , there's always , um , there's always the possibility that something can come up that takes priority , um , away from secondary priorities at that point . Um , so one of the , the , the issues that we had , um , was that we had a very strict deadline for FDA , um , investigational new drug application submission . Um , it was , you know , coming up . Um , we had to submit by the end of the day and I got a phone call from one of my coworkers who was at , uh , a patient visit . Um , and she said that , um , the patient has had a severe adverse reaction and at that point , because it involves the subject and the subject safety and welfare , um , everything else is put on hold . Um , granted that other people who , who are on the outside of this are waiting for us to submit , um , in order for them to submit . Something else may not understand . Um , why we , why I'm not able to submit , um , at a specific timeline , but patients always come first . Um , so I was at that time was very , it was very important for me to lead , um , the principal investigator to assess and gather as much information as possible in order to submit the , um , safety report to the sponsor . Um , we wanna we have a strict deadline of 24 hours . We have 24 hours to submit to the IRB as well . So , um , yeah , like that , everything else was kind of put on hold . Um , it made , you know , some , some ripples , um , between the us , the site and the sponsor for that one FDA , uh , ind application . Um , you know , it was , now we're hold off for another few months for starting that study . Uh , but I know that I made the right priority , um , and I stepped down from one priority to make sure , um , patient safety came first .",3,2.666666667,3,4,2.666666667
83,Pwggjuy-4wwuhq,"There was a time when I had a challenging environment at work , when we changed the system that we were using . Um , I was a really big process where we had to have a lot of people come in and train us . Um , it took several months to implement and it was pretty difficult to adjust to a new system and a whole new way of doing things . But , um , I did accept the changes and I decided that I was really going to hunker down and learn the new system so that I would be confident in it . And I even taught some other people how to use it when they were confused . Um , so I think the outcome of all of those steps I took was really good . Um , and I think that shows that I'm able to adapt and overcome .","I had a situation like this when we were implementing a new way of doing things . Um , a lot of people were used to one way of doing this certain , uh , report that we needed to run and the system was going to change in the way of doing it was going to change .

Um , we did explain that this new software that we're using is going to be bigger and better and everyone should be happy with the new software once it's implemented . So the result ended up being really good after a couple months .

85,Pbbz6y4-d4xyxb,"When I was working as a sales associate , I had a few situations that were quite complex . And one of note is when I had a significant clients , important client who made a very large purchase and was expecting their order , yet there was a communication error between the online portal and the shipping warehouse that we worked with and this , this resulted in a delay of their order , which was not ideal and very stressful for everyone involved . So my responsibility because I had the lead on that client was to maintain communication with them . And I think that was a very important factor in maintaining them as a client . Because you know , mistakes happen and sometimes clients are understanding , sometimes they aren't . But the most important aspect is to be honest , I , no one likes to be lied to . Everyone can really , you can see through it as well . So honesty , um , as well as constant communication , being like an open door , having an open line of communication and , and you know , really just giving them what to expect without setting false hopes or expectations . And another way that I was able to manage this situation at work was by being persistent , being on top of what I know that I needed . I had the information that I had knowing it as well , right ? Because someone else might be communicated different information and advocate for the correctness of their own , yet I know from a direct source that my information is correct . Um , so being able to really advocate for the customer as well as work together and not burning any bridges , not acting out of turn or disrespectfully , but to really serve the client's best interest as well as to foster the relationships that we had with the shipping warehouse and the outcomes were that it eventually all sorted itself out . We were able to maintain this client and stay in the good graces of our shipping partners . And you know , it really overall worked out and it's , it showed that even with mistakes , people are generally forgiving . Um , if you treat them right .","In my last position , I was tasked with quite a significant project to create a membership database . And this was important to the company because up until then they only had paper files for their members and it was quite cumbersome and challenging to access and to analyze . So this project of mine was , yes , it was complex . It was challenging , um , because it involved a lot of different factors . And again , because they were paper paper files , some employees were actually holding onto them . Things kept moving around . Uh , it was hard to stay organized and I took a few really main concrete steps that I think allowed me to succeed . Um , in the beginning I started off a little bit frazzled and a little bit unsure of how to initiate this , um , and started just trying to input data on an Excel spreadsheet . But quickly I learned that this is not , not the way to stay organized . The data looks like it looks like a mess . It's , it's , you know , there needs to be something better . So I came up with a little system . I , um , implemented some like macros on my , on my Excel sheet to automate some of the process , but I also ensured to , you know , keep the same , the same standard , the same types of data formats . Um , and I eventually got through it and was able to use Excel because it's a very , very powerful tool , um , to be able to do it . But it wasn't simply just inputting all of the data , it was to stay organized . Um , and from there I worked with an outside company that , uh , makes actual databases , um , and makes , you know , like the graphics for it and , and the online , uh , location for it . And I worked with them to , um , take my data that was organized and , and understandable into , into their systems . And I think that this was a really important thing , just taking the time to make sure that the data was neat and not soppy because the importing and it only took like a couple of hours yet . Um , we , we didn't have to change the Excel format much because it was already organized . Um , and it was already standardized . So it really helped on both ends . And , um , you also can now view it in the raw form as well as the database farm and you can interchange . So it's really made it the most user friendly , um , for all of the employees .

And one of note where I was on an especially a significant time crunch was when I was going to an investor meeting and about 15 minutes before I was told that this investor's accounts , um , I was given two pieces of information that differed from each other and the meeting was to be framed around these questions about account status and performance . Um , but I did not know the correct answers for the questions . I had two possible answers and I basically had to decide what to convey . And the first step that I took was to go to the sources of the information . Both of them were my boss , both equally credible and equally in the loop . Um , but I did , I was honest and I said , Hey , look , I got , I got two different pieces of information . What is there any reason that yours might be more recent or , or whatnot ? And they both admitted that they don't know and they're not really sure what's going on . And basically just to use my judgment . And that's exactly what I did . I took initiative and I looked at the information I tried to take , you know , a very educated guess . Um , but I also tried to ensure when I was communicating to the investor that I wasn't putting our firm in a position that could really , I guess , embarrassed or upset , um , in the event that the data was wrong . And , you know , this is , this was a very delicate situation to navigate because , um , you know , I have a responsibility to be honest . Yet at the same time , I also have the responsibility to protect the firm and to help their success . So I was , you know , I was , um , basically using , using my best judgment , trying to stay aware of the situation , trying to say honest , but also , um , to , to empathize with the frustrations of the investor . Um , and , you know , in the end I did relay the correct information , but I guess that's not the point because , you know , I guess I could have also relayed the wrong information , but even if I had , I believe that the way that I communicated , the way that I was able to , to navigate the situation allowed for the most success , even in the event that it wouldn't have been . Um , but just , you know , treating everyone with respect , treating everyone with honesty and making sure that everyone's in the loop . And I think , you know , that really , that really allowed this , this final decision to , to be a good one .","My last final season was particularly stressful because I had a few personal and um , work factors external to school that were making it quite challenging to allocate a significant time to study and to prepare for these exams .

Um , and yes , it's easy to make a plan to make your calendar look all pretty , but the important part and the challenging part is to stick to it and to have the discipline to sometimes switch focus in the middle of a flow . Um , and I think that that's a really important part and aspect to be able to almost multitask , but also to anticipate what your next , what your next move is going to be and to , to not get too comfortable , but to also allocate time for yourself . Because , um , in my planning I did schedule break times and for me it was incredibly hard to actually stick to them . It would , I would block off a time for a short lunch or , or a snack . Um , yet I was always tempted to work through it and maybe to eat . While I was working or studying . But I think that having the discipline to , to step away from it actually increased my productivity . Um , even though at the time it feels counter-productive . Like , Oh , I'm missing these 20 minutes that I could be used studying cause every minute counts . But taking that time to yourself to also just let the information simmer and to sit is really important . And I think it also allowed me these little points where I could decompress cause I was getting so much information . I was being , um , finishing so many tasks that , you know , you don't really have time to process the feelings that you're feeling . So allowing myself this time to switch between topics , um , ensure that I wasn't getting too stuck or frustrated on or , or , um , like narrow minded on a certain thing that that would inevitably frustrate me as well as not getting frustrated in myself , in my like satisfaction of life and work life balance . And yeah , it really allowed me to cope in a way that I had not previously and that I found very beneficial . And , um , you know , I think it , it just goes to show how discipline is really ruling your ability to , to function and to be productive as well as satisfied in your actions .","When I was interning at the investment fund , once I started there , I committed to working with a few different companies on their cases . And this was all great . It was something I was super passionate and excited about . But the issue started to arise when more complexities started to emerge and the cases were taking much longer than anticipated . And at this point I was faced with the reality that I might not be able to follow through with this commitment . And personally , that was very scary for me because an important value of mine is to , is your word . Because if you don't have your word , what do you have ? Um , and I pride myself in being able to follow through and if I make a commitment , if I say I'm going to do something , I do it and I do it to the best of my ability . And you know , that's something that's , that's really foundational in my value system . And the thought of falling short here . It was , it was scary at a personal level , but I was also upset that that um , this client might not be getting the level of work that they deserve . So again , touching on the communication , being able to , um , also figure out who you need to communicate to because immediately airing all of these , these anxieties to the client would not have been the best idea . But going to my boss and having an honest discussion of my workload and my ability to meet certain deadlines was very conducive to productivity and to figuring out a solution again as they are the experts as they should be . Um , what ended up working was I asked if I was , um , if I had the power to , to delegate some of my tasks even as an intern and I was given permission to , and I think that personally , it was hard for me to reconcile with this , with this idea of almost like someone else doing my work . However , I realized that delegating and working as a team , it's not , it's not you doing less , it's you getting different ideas . It's , it's again , working part of a dynamic , dynamic and interacting team requires some give and take some times . And it's just that in this situation , I think I feel more comfortable with the giving than the taking . Um , but it's , it's a personal lesson , I think . Uh , that's , that's quite , quite important and allows you to , to , you know , meet those commitments and , um , to build , to build a better relationship . And it also , it allows me to put in the most quality work that I can for the areas that I can do as well as , um , delegate and guide them . Because if I have more knowledge on the case , but in the end , it all worked .",3.666666667,4.333333333,3.666666667,4.333333333,4
86,Pr2fft3-74kptd,"Okay . So pandemic related answers are easy . So I'm going to pick a harder , uh , topic and that is just before the pandemic . We had a fire , uh , in our manufacturing facility and um , we had to um , get everybody out of the building , secure the building , get , make sure the fire was out , um , do a quick assessment on the health circumstances within the facility to make sure that there weren't any toxic fumes or anything and then immediately get in there and save whatever material we could , um , from the fire suppression situation and the smoke and everything . Um , we have very , very long lead time components , um , very sophisticated components , expensive components . And we needed , we knew that we needed to get in there and save them as quickly as possible because the ability to replace them would be such that it would be very , very difficult and machinery and the in the factory would be down for an extended period of time . So it turns out we were able to get in there , clean out the room , salvage all the material and get the line back up and running within five days , which is kind of amazing . Um , while we were doing that , we're busy doing inventory and assessing the situation and ordering replacement inventory as needed , and we were able to resume production , like I said , in five days , and stay in production .","So again , I use the example of the fire . Um , we knew we needed to get back up and running as quickly as possible . We make medical devices is imperative that we have medical devices , uh , built and available so that our customers can use them . Our customers are in situations where it's critical care , so like literally lives are running or um , or hanging in the balance of whether we can get back up and running or not . So we set a goal of seven days . Um , we assigned teams to various functions , one doing inventory , one doing cleaning , one assessing the ability to do , get back into production as far as the manufacturing equipment . And , um , another team that was just communicating out into the , uh , sales and marketing universe to let them know what the situation was too . We also put all the products on allocation hold to as well so that , uh , customers couldn't be making large orders . Uh , while we weren't sure what exactly what the situation was , all those teams , um , were , uh , populated with , uh , team members and , um , we met every day , uh , to review the work of each of the teams and , um , coordinate the next steps and everything worked really smoothly .","Okay . So , um , just a week ago as , uh , the COBIT situation in China was worsening , uh , we were hearing rumors that the production facilities over there might be shutting down from some of our key suppliers . And so we had to make a quick decision on the fly based on uncertain information as to whether or not we should ship product , um , by air from the vendor in China or by sea . If you send it by the sea , it's possible that , um , it could get stuck in a port and the port could get shut down because of coven , um , much cheaper , much longer lead time . However , uh , sending by air , expensive , like expensive by tenfold . Um , and uh , but quicker . And , uh , we made this , or I made the decision to , uh , ship the product by air . It costs us $16,000 more , but we're able to get a million dollars worth of product out of China before the production facility facilities did shut down and they did shut down three days later . Um , so we would be looking at a lost sales of a million dollars if we hadn't spent that extra $16,000 . And if I hadn't made that choice to go do that .","So I'll use the pandemic for this answer . Um , you know , two years ago when , uh , Kobe was spreading around the world for the first time and rumors were that Kobe was in the United States and he was , uh , I'm here in New York state and covert was , uh , pretty prevalent down in , uh , New York city for example . Um , it was a situation that nobody had ever seen before . We're making a lot of choices and decisions on , uh , on the fly . Um , I kind of anticipated that work from home might actually be a thing and it was back when it wasn't a thing . So I spent the week prior working with my team to , uh , order supplies , order monitors , uh , mouses , keyboards , um , all the ancillary , uh , devices in order for them to be able to work home efficiently . Um , and that was back when there weren't really shortages and that stuff at the time . So we kind of got ahead of it . Um , it was very stressful . We , I sent people home . I told everybody , take your bag home with you every day , um , with your computer just in case we get our lockdown order . And so when it happened , everyone was prepared . We'd done some drills already . Everybody had already got all the hardware in place . Um , they had already been thinking about their desks , set ups and things like that . So , um , it was very stressful . It was very uncertain . Um , to some extent people thought I was being kind of silly . But as it turns out , my team was one of the few teams that were actually equipped when we did go work from home , um , to be able to continue working , which was really critical because as businesses were cunning , continuing to shut down my team , which works as in purchasing and planning , was able to continue to work . And where that was really critical was purchasing PPE , which is something we hadn't really done before . Uh , finding masks , finding hand sanitizer , finding all the plumbing and everything that we needed to do in order to install wash bays out in the entrances . Um , so people would wash their hands before they came in the building and et cetera . So unusual time , really stressful . Um , just made a series of calculated choices . And for the most part , they all panned out .","Um , so yeah , it was just last week . Um , I had two monthly presentations that were due an hour long , uh , about to two decks of each , about 30 slides . Uh , in addition to that , at the last minute , my boss went to visit a supplier , um , In , uh , in Wisconsin and , uh , invited me along and it was a critical situation . I really wanted to go because I wanted to be involved in the discussion and , and help , um , make some decisions . Um , so I found time to do it . Uh , it was challenging . It was , it was difficult , uh , because of all the presentations that I had to do . I found a few people on my team and others that could help out in creating some of the data and creating some of the slides . And then I just , you know , work some extra hours . Um , one night while I was in Milwaukee , um , making sure everything was prepped and ready to go . And then I'd also had a chance to talk to my boss a little bit and tell him , you know , I , I'm kind of in a crunch here . Um , I'm working hard to get , make sure everything gets done , but I'm not sure every single part of the presentation that they're going to be done . And , um , so I , I guess I , uh , uh , pre notified him of that cause it turns out that I was able to get everything done in time for , uh , all the different meetings and , um , still was able to have a productive meeting with our vendor , um , in Milwaukee as well .",3.666666667,3,4,3.333333333,3
87,P9grhc3-4u63wz,"At time when I had to adapt to a changing or complex environment at work was at one of my previous longterm jobs in the diamond and find jewelry industry . When I first was brought on to work in my role as administrative slash executive assistant at this company , we were very different from even just a year and a half later when my boss at the time decided abruptly more or less that he would completely change the direction of his company and its focus . So we started out selling manufactured jewelry on a wholesale basis . And eventually years , about a year and a half , almost years down the line , he decided to shift the focus of his company to still a wholesale basis , but more so on a loose stone , um , kind of scale . And instead of doing semi-precious to precious stones , he decided to focus only on diamonds starting from around half carat and above to the much larger end of the scale . And so we decided , we decided to start wholesaling to retail companies as well as private individuals . And it was just a very , um , influx kind of situation at the time . You know , we started out manufacturing jewelry , um , from scratch pretty much . And then once he had decided to become a wholesaler of loose diamonds , um , at that time , we , he brought on an executive who ran a brand new department for the company . Um , we were always a small business , um , throughout the time that I was there . And , um , so this new executive spearheaded that department and we just basically , um , you know , followed his lead , you know , took the cues that he gave us and had to , you know , pitch in and roll up our sleeves and do whatever it took to make our own company a success in terms of , you know , putting our brand out there , our company name and reputation out there and establishing ourselves as , you know , um , a reliable fixture on the wholesale diamond market , um , locally . And also .","A time that I set goals for projects that were hard to achieve was when I was working privately with a college age student as a freelance private tutor almost two years ago now . This project and the goals , it involves where harder than usual to try to achieve because the individual I was tutoring has a developmental disability that he was born with that , um , basically impacts his motor skills . So even doing something as basic and as , um , simple for the rest of us as writing with a pen and a piece of paper is a lot more challenging and physically difficult for him . So my job at the time was to try my best , um , given , you know , the medium in which we were working and that was virtually and remotely due to the start of the COBIT pandemic . So I had to work from my own home , um , where I am and he had to work from his home where he lives in a completely different state and we would connect via Google Hangouts . Um , and I , you know , my goals were to extract as much as I could out of him . Um , in terms of , you know , pushing him , uh , to the maximum to try to improve his writing skills and ability and to do so , I would , you know , come up with , uh , assignments , topics and , uh , you know , written icebreakers for him to reflect on and to write about , um , and then send to me for me to review , edit , modify comments upon and send back to him , you know , so that proved to be pretty challenging , but it had , um , you know , its own moments of , you know , individual rewarding experiences , I would say for the both of us , or at least I'm hoping it did . And , um , you know , I feel that by the end of the , just about year and a half , um , time we had spent working together , you know , myself as his tutor and him as my , you know , um , student at the time . I felt like he had improved a lot since we had first started . And , you know , I hope he continues to grow from that point on .","A situation in which I needed to make an important decision quickly , but was faced with conf conflicting information from multiple sources , was not very long ago . It was about maybe seven to 10 days ago at my current job where a customer had placed an order for a custom request almost two months ago now and she still has not received it . So she finally reached out after nearly two months later last weekend to find out what was the status for her custom order . And for her order , she had wanted , you know , a combination of special colors , um , to be painted on to the item that she was interested in purchasing for her customer . And when she reached out by email to ask about an update for her order , um , you know , our department still hadn't finished or , um , overseeing the completion of this particular project . So we had to run it by the owner of the company . Um , who is , you know , uh , the person who makes all of the executive decisions of course , and she is my supervisor's , um , direct boss , I guess indirectly . She can be considered my boss as well . Of course . And , um , this , uh , owner has her own , uh , you know , con cognitive issues because of advanced , um , age . So perhaps in the , not long ago pass , she had actually signed off on this , um , partic particular custom project being , you know , feasible and doable . But for some reason , this particular time she was pretty firm about it from the get go when we ran it by her once again , probably for the second time in nearly two months now . And she said , um , after quickly , um , flipping through the product catalog to the page where the product was laid out , um , and also referencing the combination of special colors that the customer actually wanted . The owner said it's not possible because that kind of pain cannot be applied to that particular item . There was a bit of back and forth and eventually it was resolved and the customer will be getting her custom item after all .","At time when I had to cope with a high pressure or stressful situation at work or in school was Quite a long time ago . Um , during my sophomore year of college . And I had to take my final exam , I believe it was . And it was for , um , a beginner level introductory art history course , which was part of , um , the core curriculum for freshmen and sophomores at my university . Um , and it was extremely challenging and high stakes because there was a lot , and I'm talking about a lot of memorization and instant recall involved for that entire course . Um , so for my final exam , we all had to , you know , prepare and study for an exam where anything and everything we had studied , um , throughout the entire semester was in , uh , you know , involved and fair game . So we had to prepare for that final by , um , studying many works of art that we had already studied . Um , for the previous three to three and a half months before . And for the final , we had to memorize the name of the artist , the title of the piece of art as well as the year in which the artwork was made . And it wasn't just like five or 10 , you know , titles or you know , works of art . It was probably more like 80 to 100 works of art that we all have to memorize on our own and be ready for when the final exam came around . It was extremely stressful because , um , if you weren't familiar with or exposed to this particular kind of world , um , you know , the art history world previously , it was completely brand new to you . I responded by preparing well ahead of time and I got an a at the end .","A time when I experienced difficulty keeping a commitment made at work due to other important priorities that I was handling was during the phase when my boss at the time decided he was going to launch his brand new eCommerce website . And I was , um , one of the main people put in charge of creating and putting it together , the written content for his website . So there were different aspects and components , um , of the written content that needed to get done . And one of them of course was the education section for the website . Um , that was for consumers who was con , who are completely brand new to the world of diamonds . And , you know , it was my job as the writer and I suppose as the educator to , you know , lay out in layman's terms what exactly diamonds were , why they were important , why they are valuable , et cetera , et cetera . Um , aside from writing the education section , um , he also wanted a blog component , um , launched and updated regularly . And that component also required a lot of time . Um , so it was nearly impossible for me to be working on both at once . And to finish both , you know , if each equally require their own amounts of research , writing , editing , rewriting , um , you know , modifying , et cetera . Um , eventually he did bring out a couple of new hires and you know , those people , even though they were , um , brought on to handle their own set of responsibilities , uh , they eventually helped pitch in with a lot of the writing , um , particularly the blog writing . Um , so that took a , you know , a huge burden off of me for a time . Um , I think it's important for me to emphasize that it , you do need to take a step back at times like that to assess what is most important and what is most crucial and what is truly top priority to work on first and go from there . And once you're done with , you know , the top most important priority on your to do list , then you can move on to the rest . And , um , by the end you will be more successful .",2,2.75,2.333333333,2.333333333,2.666666667
88,Pmyiqr9-eh6jzw,"My former career was at a collection agency that dealt with landlord tenant law . So I , I interface with courts and attorneys quite a bit . Um , due to the nature of the business , they were a lot of state and federal laws and sometimes conflicted with each other that we had to comply with . And it was never changing legal environment , uh , federal federal legislatures continually writing new laws or continue to think about writing new laws . Um , they had a major project and there was a revision to the fair debt collection practices act and I was the one in charge in my office of keeping abreast of what changes were proposed and , and reading the various drafts of the law . So I'm committed a couple hours a week to doing that to stay , uh , make sure we were in compliance with that . We were fortunate that for the most part we were already doing what we were , would be required to do . We were doing is on her own just to keep herself safe and out of lawsuits and so forth . But , uh , it was an ongoing challenge , uh , in a good way , I guess , to , to stay abreast of those changes until the final version of the law came out , which was after I left the organization .","I mentioned in a previous question that I was , um , kind of middle management at a , uh , small coin collection agency and a lot of it dealt with dealing with the courts , but I also actually did collections and the company had been in business for over 50 years . When I left the company and I was , uh , had the highest performing months of any collector ever at the agency , I would set goal as far as monetary collections . Um , I would set numerical goals for myself or myself and , um , prepare the paperwork for the attorney , Um , To get people into court . They had a judgment against them and I find them on their jobs and so forth . And I would set myself a number , the legal terms of proceeding supplemental and I'd set a goal for myself to get a certain number a day to give people a court . The idea is normally just , you know , it would kind of flush them out and then they could either pay it off or we'd make some kind of arrangement . We weren't necessarily , we worked with them so their , their wages were not garner sheet . Um , if they just neglected , then of course the money would come out of their paycheck , but I would set a certain number of posts , ups that I would want to work on a day , get a certain number filed a week , And You have a certain number of paid off per month . And like I said , I was the had individual months that were the highest performances of all time and the 50 year history of this business .","So in my role as a bill collector at this small agency , um , like I said , people , the idea with the proceeding supplementals was to just to get people to contact us . They get served by the court and their employer would get some paperwork called interrogatory , which was a questionnaire about their earnings . And people would often call in and sometimes it'd be upset and they'd want to , you know , yell and they're going to come down and beat me up or something or whatever . Um , but a lot of times we would call in and they , we would have one source of information . The employer had filled up this quarter written rogatory . And so they made X amount of dollars per month . And I'm not picking this about one particular instance . This is something that happened fairly routinely and they would call in and they would , um , say , well , I don't work there anymore . I quit . Or , or whatever . Or they file bankruptcy . We checked with the bankruptcy court . So we'd have these , um , contradict information from employer versus what the person was telling us . And some people just didn't really want to pay judgments that they had been adjudicated against them . So I have different sources , different conflicting information . Um , I would use my best judgment and more often than not , you know , and sometimes I would just not budge and I'd say , you know , there's no settlement . Other times that offer a settlement , they'd offer something I've accepted . Um , and this happened , you know , a few hundred times or more throughout the course of my 10 year career there . Um , but we routinely make your survey , they were $4,000 and they're offering 2000 , I'd offer 3,500 . They come to 3,200 , something like that . That was pretty , pretty common that that was the size of the judges usually worked with . Um , did that at least a few times a week . Um , and just weigh all the evidence that was in front of me , whether , you know , if I really thought they might file bankruptcy , I might accept a lower settlement if I didn't , you know , it just , it was kind of off the cuff and very , um , had to be very , uh , kind of quick on feet to , uh , respond to these people and whether you believe what they're telling you or not .","So after I decided to leave this coaching , see , I decided to go back to school to initially pursue a masters in physics . I have a BS in physics from many years ago and now Google from now on pursuing a PhD . Um , and this was kind of not the high to covert , but there were still man mass mandates and things so forth . They had just come back in the fall semester from being all remote and um , I hadn't taken the college class then hit pig and examined the college class since the early two thousands when I was saying some computer science stuff . So the first exam was in a advanced mechanics class and it didn't really think about , so I have , I wear glasses and they're just reading glasses and had to wear a mask . And as I was taking the , the exam , my glasses were just immediately fogged up . I couldn't see , I basically had a panic attack . Um , but really I just , school is not gonna work out for me . And spent an hour and 15 minutes , about an hour just having anxiety . In the last 15 minutes , I settled down and answered all the questions , um , didn't do quite as well on that exam as I hoped , but I didn't do poorly . Um , I resolve the situation by thinking , okay , I need you to do something with , some of my bosses don't fog up . So I bought some anti-fog spray that I could put on . I could spray every couple of days for him and glasses so they don't fall . Started wearing other types of masks that didn't allow the fog to come up in the glasses so much . Um , ended up getting an a in the class , did well , you know , having another good semester . So , um , it wasn't ideal that first test , but I figured out how to resolve the situation so it wouldn't happen again . I , I did well enough on the test to get an a in the class , like I said , and everything ended well .","So when to described my current situation rather than the career I talked about that I was in for about 12 years . I'm currently in grad school . I also employed through the university . I , um , basically a teaching position and I have where I teach help , uh , help a tenure professor teach three , three tenured professors , speech , teach three separate classes . And then I have a part time job in a tutor lab they have for the undergraduate , some of the undergraduate physics , physics classes . And uh , right now I have a lot of commitments at work , other commitments . Um , I have some time , this not this week , next week scheduled in the tutor lab and I have some commitments to my , in my , in my graduate department that I'm required to attend some symposiums and things like that . So , um , talk to the graduate department secretary , um , asked if she wanted me to pray via through the , um , head of the graduate department , whether she wanted me to prioritize this job that I have are , are attending to other things . That's a commitment that , you know , makes the department look good when you're a good turnout . We can talk to these boozy professors . It makes it worth their while that they traveled halfway across the country in a pandemic . So they didn't come for , for nobody to talk to her , um , find out what she wants me to do , which is attendance , symposia , and these other commitments . So that's what I'll be doing . Um , you know , one is kind of a painting , but the other is good for the department , you know , benefits me in the long run . Um , so it's just a matter of prioritizing what's more important . The big picture right now , um , all the classes I teach just have exams last week . So they tend to come into this tutor lab before right before exams . So probably we won't be very busy this week and there may be one or two people and I'll just have someone cover for me and I'll attend these other things that are a little more more , uh , high profile and hopefully make the department look good .",3,3.5,2.666666667,2.666666667,3
89,Pdv25g6-2e5mcj,"So one time in the past , um , on one of the projects I was working on , um , I was actually responsible for gathering some of the requirements from the business side and , um , you know , meeting with the technical teams just to uh , tie the bridges and make sure communication and , and everything was going through . Um , there was sort of a disconnect between these two sides and that the business thought they were getting a certain product . Um , but you know , halfway down the project , um , the technical teams ran into a roadblock and it turns out , you know , they couldn't do it and they couldn't fulfill the requirements . So , um , definitely a lot changed and it was a sort of a complex task to meet with the technical team understanding of what the issue is , what are our next steps and you know , the possible avenues we can take . So , um , in that situation , what I really relied on the most was , um , making sure there's open lines of communication between the business side and the technical teams . Um , you know , obviously the business side isn't going to understand every nitty gritty detail that the tech team presents . But , um , in opposition I was really able to summarize or first of all , understand , um , to a relatively high degree of detail what the issue is on from a technical standpoint and then relay that information in a more understandable , um , way and a clear , concise way to the client and the business side so that they can then make an informed decision on how to proceed . So , um , basically doing that and making sure that it was very open and consistent communication , so there were no surprises , um , you know , further on , into the project . Um , and so I was able to do that successfully . And , um , it all ended up , well , you know , the technical team was able to identify a second path , uh , that they could proceed with on the project . Um , I was able to relay that information and meet with the business side . Um , and they were , uh , they were okay with it . Um , so they gave the go ahead and then , uh , basically everything from there proceeded smoothly . But , um , you know , I think that ability on my end to , um , understand those technical details and in a concise and clear way , you know , relay that information to the business side , uh , make sure you know , everybody's on the same page and , um , knows what's going on . Uh , in a , in a , uh , a short timeframe . Um , I think really helped , uh , that project along and made sure that it ended up favorably , favorably .","So generally in most of the projects I'm working on , I set , um , relatively aggressive timelines or timeline goals for the project in general . Um , that's just , you know , something I'm used to . And , uh , with that being said , there's an understanding that it is an aggressive timeline and it can be sort of scaled back , uh , in places if necessary . But I find that that timeline gives enough leeway and room for those unexpected , um , events or occurrences or roadblocks and , um , you know , the timeline can then be adjusted as such , rather than having a timeline that's already been stretched out and then not really having too much wheel wheel room halfway through the project . Um , so in one of those situations , uh , I had set goals for about , I'd say 75% of the expected timeline that that's what we were sort of shooting for on the project . And , um , basically to reach those goals . Um , the , the main path or the main step I took was , uh , mapping out a proper timeline and a proper , uh , secondary or sub goals leading up to the , the whole overarching project . Um , and just in a way that even if we weren't going to reach that , that very , um , high or large goal , we were able to meet these smaller milestones and track our progress throughout the course of the project . So , you know , halfway through we would see , okay , this has been checked and we've reached in two or three weeks or whatever the case . Um , and that's a really good tool to track our progress and then readjust or reevaluate on the timeline . So , um , basically in that situation , making sure that , um , these smaller milestones were being met and tracking progress more frequently . And in that case , um , the goals were actually being met and , um , you know , the , the project went through smoothly and we finished in around 75% of the , uh , recommended or initially assumed a timeline for that project . Um , in some cases I have worked on projects where , you know , we had hit a roadblock , but making sure that I'm working closely with the team . Um , and they're bringing these issues to me as they arise . Um , in those cases where they feel we've hit a roadblock , then we can reassess that timeline and then push it out as soon as possible . And with all the stakeholders and anyone to anyone else , you know , dependent on this project , no way ahead of time . So they can adjust for that too .","Yes . So , uh , in one , one situation where I was faced with making a decision very quickly , um , I had a meeting with stakeholders in the afternoon of the , of this day . Um , and in the morning I had a meeting with my technical team just to go over all the slide decks and the details , excuse me , in the , in the presentation that , uh , you know , we were going to be passing on the stakeholders as sort of an update . Um , and there were two team members particularly who had a sort of a disagreement , um , about one of the , the , the core details on the project that I was going to be presenting . Um , and they both sort of worked on parts of it , but neither one of them had the holistic or comprehensive view because it was sort of done in pieces . Um , so it was a small technical detail , but it was still like important , um , to showcase to the stakeholders . Um , so in that case , I didn't have a ton of time to go back and check the sources or you know , ask some of the technical , uh , members to go and double check those things for me . Um , but what I was able to do is listen to each , um , person's opinion in that case or what they thought the correct , uh , approach was , um , and then make a decision to sort of abstract it a little bit or generalize it a little bit . Um , I think it's important not to provide false information wherever possible . Um , and in some cases , you know , you're not able to go into as much detail as you would like , but what I did was abstracted a little bit to where I could be sure I'm not providing false information to , um , to these stakeholders . Um , so although I had conflicting information , whatever they were able to agree on , I showcased and I added in that we were still working on a couple of these points and I was going to double check and shoot out an email followup from the meeting with the stakeholders just with an updated , um , with updated information regarding to that point . So in the next two or three days , the technical team was able to nail it down and figure out exactly what was uh , going on and what we could showcase . And then I followed that up to the stakeholders . So I think in that case , everyone was understanding and there were no , there was no false information being put out there or expectations weren't sort of raised in the brought down . So I think it , it ended up pretty favorably . And , um , I was just able to , um , sort of convey what I knew . And that's sort of the approach I always take . Um , be upfront with everyone on the team and not try to sort of hide anything or , um , you know , slip anything under the rug .","Yeah . So this , uh , this one week actually , uh , when I was in school , um , I was , it was an exam week . Um , but I was also interviewing for multiple positions , uh , for multiple jobs . Um , so I think I had something like , you know , four or five exams in this one week and then also like three or four interviews , like big interviews that I needed to prepare for . So definitely as I can remember , one of the most stressful weeks of my life . Um , but basically my approach in that situation and any stressful situation is just to break it down . Um , sort of compartmentalize each task that needs to be done . Um , cause when you're looking at them individually as leave , at least for myself , it's much more manageable and doable . Um , so identify each task that needs to be done , what in in some degree of detail , what , um , particularly needs to be done for that task in terms of preparation , in terms of , um , you know , studying or , or , uh , doing mock interviews , you know , whatever it is and try to time box it a little bit . Put , how much prep time do you think you're going to take ? Um , then once I have that down on , then also prioritize . So if there's one job that I really want , you know , that's going to have a higher priority over , um , preparing for the other interview . So once I have those details down in terms of what needs to be done , how long is it gonna take and what's the priority ? It becomes a lot more manageable to start off with . Okay , I'm going to start with preparing for this exam that I'm going to move over and spend this much time preparing for this interview . And , uh , it also would decrease my stress a little bit because I know , okay , these high priority items are going to be done . Um , if I don't get to this , you know , item XYZ , that's okay because I finished these high priority tasks and then if I have extra time , great . If I don't , that's also okay . It's understandable . Um , and then in the workplace , you know , I do the same thing . I break it down and I make sure I get these high priority tasks done and then convey that to , uh , you know , my manager or stakeholders or whatever , if there's some lower priority tasks that are going to spill over or are going to be done in time . Um , so it , it worked well for me . Um , I know I did well on most of the exams . I think one of them I was already doing well in the class . Uh , so I didn't have to study too much for the hot one . And , uh , the interviews , uh , as far as I can remember , uh , went well as well . But , uh , generally any stressful situations , uh , that always seems to work for me .","Yeah . So I think the situation is a little similar to the previous question where I , uh , sometimes at work or one or two weeks , a period where I had , uh , multiple projects , I was moving from one team to the other end that was sort of onboarding or with a small assignment on one team and finishing up on a , on a previous project . So I don't think that was totally calculated in my move over just in that one or two week period . But that was the case . So I had a lot of work on my plate and , um , it was a bit of stressful situation again . Um , so I wasn't able to finish all the work by the deadline that was given to me at that time because it was just so much going on . Um , but in that , in that scenario , basically what I did was prioritize it . So I made sure the high priority tasks on each project were done and that wasn't , you know , leaving anyone high and dry . And , um , I gave everyone a heads up notice and that in that case as well , that Hey , this is , this is the situation , I'm sort of working on a couple of different projects right now and it's a little bit out of my scope . So it's possible that this task may spill over and may not be done in time , but I'll make sure I get this part done . You know , whatever I knew I could get done . Um , and everyone was really understanding because I was providing them with , uh , quite a bit of advanced notice . Um , and so I was actually able to get more done than I thought I would . So it's a pleasant surprise . I did , um , fail to meet a couple of commitments , but I'd already approached them with that . So when the time came , they had already prepared for it and they were understanding . One of my coworkers took up one of my tasks for me . One was a bit lower priority , so it , uh , it was OK for it to go over , um , past the sort of deadline and it was taken care of after that . But , um , sort of my philosophy there is just make sure there's no surprises for anyone . So , um , when the day comes to deliver something , if , uh , they , they should know ahead of that at a time as much as possible . Of course , everybody involved . So I take that with me wherever I go , and it's always worked out . I think people are generally more receptive and helpful when they have that advanced notice .",4,4,4,3.333333333,3
90,Pmvmhdy-h8bwwv,"So One of the , one of the times I did , um , so one of the times I ran into a complex issue at work was There was a moment that our superintendent and some of our members wanted to put our , our organization , uh , more public . They wanted , they wanted more advertisement . This is something that we've never done before . We're a nonprofit . Uh , so they knew I was technically I'm good at , at all , all sorts of different tech and I could absorb it very easily . Uh , so they , what they did is they asked , well , can , can we do a podcast ? Can we update our website ? Can we , you know , they had a lot of , uh , projects I wanted to get done and no one in the room knew how to do either except me . So I took on , instead of them hiring out and wasting a ton of money . Uh , they , I , that I took on those roles and I created a very nice website and I am recording podcasts for , uh , different , uh , professional learning , um , um , coaches , uh , to help him , you know , to help all our teachers , all our , all , everyone who works , we are , we have something for everyone on our podcast . So , yeah , they , uh , that was a lot of adapting on top of just what I do regularly , which is basically the technical side and networking and computers and all that fun stuff . So I am , uh , I have a brain for a technical equipment and , uh , computers and all that , but I , I was able to , uh , adapt to a sound recording and , and website design . So that is my response .","After we were done working remote after Colvin , um , We had to put in place a different way to do our board meetings . We couldn't go get into a little room and talk anymore and invite the public out for public comment . We needed to put in place a different whole different setup and we needed to stream it live and we needed it to sound good and to look good . We needed to come up with something in about two weeks time . So what we did is we split up some of our duties . We , I ordered all the equipment , the sound equipment , the um , the , the cameras , the , the projector And . We had to set up in a whole different area that we were normally , we normally have a boardroom , but we had to set up in a , in a gymnasium . Um , I take that back , it's more like a lunch room . And so the goal was to get two weeks , have that all , all set up , ready to go . So with , uh , the help of the rest of the tech team , we set up a way to , Mmm . Make it work . It took a lot of testing , a lot of , um , there was a couple bumps in the road where the equipment wasn't exactly what we were looking for , so we had to quickly , uh , order some specialized equipment . Um , So that was a , That was a tall task and we pulled it off . I got the right people on it , and the result was , um , a good first run , uh , with the board board , um , with the board meeting . Uh , great livestream . Uh , everything went well . Um , little bit of sound issues and we've fixed that for the second board meeting . Um , Sure . And now everything works well . Soon there'll be coming back to the boardroom , but for temporary livestreaming board meetings , we knocked it out the park . No .","A few weeks back , we had a flood in our basement and in the basement we have all our server , uh , equipment and we have , uh , lots of different other equipment and we have a library . I heard from our maintenance guy in the morning that there's about three inches of water and it's , everything is Flooded . I mean , everything was , everything's destroyed . I had trouble believing this , um , because I've , I've been there a long time and I , I've , I've seen pretty bad floods down there and I thought we took care of it , but this was a different kind of flood . This was a burst pipe . Um , so I didn't panic . My network guy , he panicked . He thought everything was screwed up . Um , He gave , he called me and said , Oh , I think everything's ruined . Every bottle . You know , it was a big panic situation . And , uh , so my actions were , I , I got to work ASAP . As soon as I got the phone call early in the morning , uh , I assessed the damage . It was already , most of the water was being pumped out . Took a look around . Uh , our server equipments on racks didn't hit those . None of the , none of the water was , it was a bad flood , but it didn't hit the , um , uh , the equipment . Uh , I think the only damage you really got out of the whole thing was a , um , an old monitor that was left on the floor and we were very lucky . Um , some of the boxes of paper weren't so lucky . There was some paper that got destroyed , but uh , but yeah , I uh , had to haul a lot of stuff up that day and I had to create little offices for some of the people that work downstairs in the library , um , temporary officer with the phones and everything . So , uh , the outcome is really good . We're , um , moving back in now . Um , it's been , all the drywall has been replaced and uh , we're making a , they all made a good progress , so we are ready to set up shop again . And , uh , I made sure everything went smoothly . Everyone had nothing but good things to say . So , yeah , That is my , no sweat . My , no sweat , uh , response . I , I don't , I don't really get anxious or nervous . I try , you know , what can you do ? It's a flood . Um , but we are all okay now and everything's fine .","Yeah , Yeah . So , um , my superintendent was out at a , at a , at a seminar and she was presenting and her laptop just decided to completely fry out and she plugged something into her laptop , like a , a video , a video wire or something for her to protect her and it shorted the laptop . So that was a big panic and this was a major presentation and it was , it could have been a disaster . But I , uh , I knew of the product . I knew that she was going to be doing a presentation . I knew where it was at and I was able to bring her a laptop . I actually had a laptop with , or I left . Uh , I gave it to the secretary . Um , just in case these things happen , uh , they were able to , um , Um , started up , but they couldn't , uh , they wanted me because I'm the tech person there . Uh , so when I got there , uh , everything was kind of awkward because everyone's just kind of staring off and chatting and , you know , not paying attention . And , you know , it had to have been embarrassing for her . But , uh , my quickly swapped out the laptops , um , got her up and going and she saved her PowerPoint , uh , on Google drive . So that was really easy to pull up . And , um , it was , Yeah , It went on without a hitch . After that , um , I was able to recover her hard drive and , uh , get her another laptop and , uh , I just took it easy on that . I , I didn't panic and everyone was done and everyone was happy . And at the end .","So , um , we , at the beginning of the school year , I get a bump . I get , uh , my , my schedule pretty much filled with all sorts of different seminars and things like that that are being presented all around Northern are , uh , Northern part of our state . Um , something came up where I could not make it into work , Mmm . At the , at , at the times they wanted me there to set up these places , uh , for like a week and , um , that , that caused a major headache . But what I was able to do is work out a plan with one of my coworkers and set up a time where he could come out and I could show him the layout of a lot of the places . Um , and he helped me through that , uh , because I just , there was some personal issues happening where I just couldn't make it on time . Uh , I had to come in an hour later . Uh , he was able to take care of all the different seminars for me . Um , and then he , when he went on vacation , I , I helped him out . I helped do some of his duties at his , his place . So , um , everything turned out fine . And , uh , you know , it wasn't planned . I think it was kind of out of the blue what happened . But , um , because of my good relationships with my coworkers , we were able to hammer out a good deal . So that's , that .",3.666666667,3,3.333333333,2.333333333,3.333333333
91,Pww4byw-6dvq76,"At time where I had to adapt to a change in our complex environment at work was during , um , the startup , Colvin obviously with Colvin . Um , no one really knew what was happening . There was so many changing circumstances regarding um , public health measures , um , safety of employees , um , and completely converting into a remote work model for employees . Um , and having worked in the healthcare sector during the start of Colvin , um , there was a lot of complexities that , um , were happening in terms of how do we shift our workforce , um , to in-person to a work from home model but still keeping our clientele safe , still keeping our frontline safe . So , um , there was a lot of changing , um , priorities , changing circumstances with public health measures , masking , distancing , having to remodel some of our office space , having to shift , um , all of our office space into a remote work model . Um , so as the steps that we took to adapt to this outcome was to , um , go team by team to ensure that everyone was a well equipped with the proper , um , with the proper technology to proper equipment . Um , laptops , chargers , docking station . So on and so forth . So that every team who was able to work from home , um , was able to replicate the work environment . Um , but there's also , um , ensuring that the workplace itself was safe . So ensuring that we had , um , preaching and questionnaires , masking , um , uh , an entry station where people , uh , where we had a security guard checking , um , entrances and checking to ensure that , um , we were filling out the questionnaire correctly . So there's a lot of steps that we took in terms of ensuring that employees felt safe coming to work . But we're also following public health protocols . Um , an outcome of these steps was that we were successfully able to pivot from a , from an office space to a work from home model , but yet still keeping our clients care , stoke , ensuring that our frontline staff felt safe as well .","A time where I had to set goals for a project or hard to achieve , um , was during year-end season . So essentially I had two projects on the go for year end . The first one was our , um , consolidation of all of our reports , number of salaries , um , for our audit . But the second one , the second one was our year end tax forms and calculate pension adjustments . And these two projects were , um , had the same deadline . I was working on them simultaneously at the same time . So it was very difficult to ensure that , um , each project had , um , my commitment and time invested into it . So , um , the goals for each project set up was I was supposed to run reports , analyze , um , all of the salaries , put them in one spreadsheet , um , calculate overtime , calculate vacation . But on the same hand , I also had to set goals for the , for the tax project where I had to run all of the reports , calculate every individual pension adjustment . So , um , there were quite difficult to achieve because I was the one person doing both of those projects and we had about 250 employees where each , um , for each project that I had to do . So it was quite difficult and very time consuming to ensure that again , my time was invested into each project . However , the steps I took to achieve these goals and reach them was that I broke down each individual project at each individual task for each project . I assigned myself specific weeks , specific days where I had to , where I focused on one project itself . We're at an bouncing back and forth between them on the same day so that I wasn't competing myself . So it was easier for me to break down the project into smaller steps and more manageable timelines and date for myself . So I set deadlines for myself . I set my , I put aside some time to dedicate to each project . Um , the result was , um , the projects were completed on time . Um , obviously with , um , working on two huge projects , there were some mistakes that were made , but , um , stuff that was very easily bubble , um , that was very easily resolvable . So all in all a , they were successful projects .","In a situation where I needed to make an important decision quickly , but let's face with conflicting information from multiple sources was when we were trying to terminate one of our managers . Um , having worked with this manager for a few years , we actually became very good friends , so I knew them personally outside of work , we hung out . Um , we had the same friend groups , so , um , I knew them on a personal basis , but I also need them professional basis . Um , however , um , certain Fox came to light where it , um , it was discovered that they were possibly stealing money from the company . Um , and as one of the HR reps of the company , we had to investigate and we had to make a decision fairly quickly because we didn't want , we didn't want it to Trek out for so long . Um , but I was faced with conflicting information because , um , just the information that I had personally about their purse , their work ethic , um , they've never had any disciplinary records . They've never , um , had any bad reviews and I knew them on a personal basis and I knew it was outside of their character . Um , but then we were faced with information from our loss prevention agent camera videos . Um , and so it was very difficult to , um , come up with , uh , a decision quickly on my end . I wanted to have more time to investigate , talk more if the manager get all sides of the stories . Um , however , with , um , with my managers coming down on me , it was , um , the decision needed to be done quite quickly . So we ended up terminating the manager . Um , and in my mind , being a business professional , I knew it was the , those were the right choice for the business . We are , um , we have to think about the reputation of the business to South Nova workforce as well .","An example of a time where I had to cope with a high pressure , stressful situation at work , um , was when we discovered one of our employees , um , was viciously attacked and I passed away from that attack . Um , it was a completely random attack on the streets , um , and it was completely senseless . Um , it was also during a time where everyone was , um , very stressed . There's a lot of anxiety due to Cove . It , uh , we were working in the healthcare sector , so , um , and the , the employee had made an impact on the organization , made it in back home employees , and they were very well loved . So it was very stressful , um , having to cope with the loss of the employee , but also having to handle , um , the other employees or team members to ensure that , um , everyone had the right support and resources needed for this time of grief . Um , it was also very stressful managing , uh , the insurance policies , the benefits , the payouts , and communicating with their family and their loved ones in terms of what steps needed to be done . Um , however , I responded with a lot of compassion with a lot of empathy . Um , I listened to all my employees . I offered my time and , um , counseling to them . So , um , they knew that they had someone there for them , and I was able to , um , help provide support to the employee's loved ones as well , so that they , um , had a peace of mind in managing the , the estate .","A time where I experienced difficulty keeping commitment I made due to other priorities at work was when I had booked myself into an event for an organization . I was one of their guest speakers . I was hosting an info session and I had already booked out a couple of months back . However , on the day of , um , one of my SVPs had messaged me very urgently about a report , I had to run an analyze and extract for them . So , um , this report would take the hours which would then go into and prevent me from attending this , um , this event itself . Um , so in terms of what steps I did , um , I spoke to the event organizer . I apologize . I let them know I had , um , competing priorities right now that I had a urgent report that needed to be completed , um , by end of day and I was not able to make my commitment . However , I did offer up , um , alternative times for me to , um , come together again with the attendees and do my booth and speech with them . So I did offer , um , a later time for us to reschedule and redo the booth itself . So in terms of the outcome , I did complete the report , um , that was urgently needed . And then I also a week later , was able to meet with the organizers and intend these to fulfill my commitment there .",3.666666667,2.5,3,3.666666667,3
92,Pqsxt4p-3c2fyh,"Well , one real challenge and change that we all had to go through in the past few years was the co of a 19 pandemic , uh , the entirety of the workspace change . And along with that came a series of complex challenges and obstacles that we've had to overcome . Uh , the fears of both the illness as well as the isolation from working from home was a real difficult situation for a lot of my team members . So I personally took the initiative to teach and educate my team about online platforms and how we can coordinate a bit better through use of programs like teams , as well as encouraging them to set things up through emails , coordinate with one another a bit better , and learn to not rely on face to face communication for everything , which is something that we've always had to do in the past . And I believe that this will not just benefit us for this pandemic in the last few years , but it's worthwhile skills to learn moving into the future , whatever , 2022 and beyond there . Hold for us .","So I set for myself goals above and beyond what my initial original position called for . Um , my desire was to have the most effective team within our organization . And nor to do this , I sat down one on one with all of my team members and told them what I expect from them and what they should deliver to me on time . I let them know quite clearly what I expect from them and I gave them as much free room to wiggle within that as they see fit . So I work hands off from my employees , but I make sure that , uh , they understand that I have certain expectations from them . So they are always on time . They're always on budget and they're always working towards something rather than trying to stagnate . So in order to become the best possible manager I can within this field , I lend myself to teamwork and to communication and essentially working always forward , always making sure that we have one step towards the next goal of ours , which is ultimately to be the highest functioning unit within the company .","So we were getting the ball rolling on a recent project when suddenly we were informed that we had a higher profile client looking to move forward with his project instead . Uh , I heard from multiple higher ups that we didn't have the manpower or ability to solve this complex and overbearing problem . But through my leadership , I was able to work with my team to create a way to handle both clients at once and deliver excellent results . Uh , I received high marks and compliments from both sides . Both , uh , both clients that we worked with were absolutely satisfied with their project or their , their product . And they simply told me how great it was to work with me and how I , and our team , how wonderful we were , how great and communicating we were and how satisfied they were with the results . And I believe that I can translate that , that work , that level of leadership and control and smooth on a salable confidence to get the project done into work for you .","So a common stressful situation at work is dealing with multiple clients and being able to manage my time in an effective manner . Often I'm overloaded with emails and requests , but over time I've learned how to realize what requires the most of my attention and what's really stands out to me as something that is urgent versus something that can be put off to the side . Uh , as well as the ability to delegate tasks to others by having an organized schedule along with a good command of who I'm working with . I create a malleable environment that allows for flexibility in the face of crisis and the ability to please multiple parties at once .","So I've had problems keeping two meetings in the past with schedules that conflict with my own as well as always being busy . There've been numerous times where I've needed to reschedule phone meetings , Zuora to make sh make time to reach every individual client . Uh , however I have been in , I have developed a keen sense for conflict resolution and a knowledge of how to talk with people . If I know schedule , then conflict is going to arise . I reach out to them prior and explain that I'll need to reschedule for the future . I let them know that I'm fully committed to them and more often than not , I believe that people are very agreeable . If you tell them up front why something is , say , preventing a meeting or any other sort of conflicts that arise if you talk with them and work something out . More often than not , people are very flexible . They want to come to an understanding , Oh , I've actually been complemented for my good communication skills by clients in the past . I know that this will continue into the future , especially working underneath this role .",3.666666667,2.5,2.666666667,2.666666667,3
93,Psy6vw3-4rtcsi,"I was the senior auditor for an internal audit of one of the banks , new fraud investigation departments . And it was complex as it was the first time for that department to get audited . And they were not familiar with the steps in an audit and it was also classified as a high risk audit . So the task or project involved with working with that new fraud investigation department as well as my own teams so that we can complete all audit procedures , uh , before a tight quarter end deadline . So as it was like a first time audit , I modified adapt to my approach to use less complex terminology , um , in all the email and verbal communications . I also made sure to prepare a week in advance of the audit , given the complexity and high risk of a first time project or audit and to ensure that my team would be well versed regarding the responsibilities required . And lastly , I reached out early to the department , uh , in order to help address any questions that were asked and to also build that rapport so that they'll be comfortable with the audit project and all the nuances with the audit , uh , from the very start . So as a result , uh , we were able to complete the audit on time , uh , with limited issues from both my team and the department . And the department was very satisfied with our work and we were given positive evaluations , um , from both the client as well as our teams , uh , audit teams executive .","So there was one project that I was assigned a year ago to develop a new automated email tracking process and this was requested by our audit quality assurance team as they were currently using outlook to manually sift through all the emails and any technical questions that were submitted to them . However , due to the , due to the manual process , there were several times in which they missed or forgotten emails , which was resulted in I guess important audit questions not being responded to or addressed . Uh , as there was no current process in place , I was given flexibility on how we can solve this problem . So as there weren't any defined goals for this project yet , I took the initiative to speak with members of the DQA or audit quality assurance team as well as the company's audit staff in order to understand their problems and needs in full . Uh , so for example , I learned that the QA team and half of the company's audit staff weren't very comfortable with using complex technology or tools . So one of my goals was to ensure that the solution was , was simple to use as well as using like basic Microsoft programs , which they're familiar with . Um , so what I did was like , I immediately started Googling and researching , um , all the different types of Microsoft tools to find out what the best solution is to meet the needs of the team . So , um , I was using all of the internal resources that was provided within , um , the company's , uh , technological , uh , resource site , uh , as well as doing my own external research and my own spare time as well . And I found out there's a particular tool called Microsoft power automate , which would meet the needs of their , of their goal , like the goal , the project's goal as well as the needs of the stakeholders . So what I do is like I started extensively learning the tool , um , sometimes , you know , in my own spare time , uh , to , to I guess , develop a prototype of the potential and product that they'll use . And , uh , I was able to actually like learn the tool and develop a working prototype to basically automate the whole process in terms of the intake of the email to tracking the email , like the status , like whether it's in progress or complete , um , as well as having the automated system that would automatically reply , uh , with , uh , I guess sample answers if it's a common question that's being asked . So I guess as a result , uh , the , the project was shown to the audit teams and as well as a QA team , they were very impressed . Uh , so yeah , we had our staff , or at least from our project side to help focus on , uh , sort of having the solution ironed out and they're still using the tool today and yeah , all the questions and , uh , emails are being tracked effectively , uh , and none of them were being missed at the moment .","Uh , so one of my current projects is to track the productivity initiatives within our financial institution , uh , which is the company that I'm currently working at . And we typically would take a lot of , um , inputs or take the values and the submissions from various different departments , tilt groups , uh , in order to complete this final , uh , PowerPoint file , which is summarized and then use for executive reporting . Uh , so there was at least a few times in which we noticed that the numbers were different . So this , and we had to get our executive reporting sentence out , um , before the end of this week . So what we did when we noticed these , um , discrepancies and the , the , the metrics or the information that was provided , we reached out to the teams that , uh , had that conflicting information . Uh , we basically explained to them that we saw , uh , an issue or discrepancy and we just wanted to investigate or we didn't use the word investigate , but we wanted to , uh , find out , uh , what was the cause or if there's any like confusion or any timing differences regarding the submissions . Uh , so yeah , what I did was like , I sent an email just in a very friendly manner , try to explain like the issue that we have and then try to get like a , a solution that is agreed upon by all parties in the end . So as a result of my actions , uh , we found out that yet it was just a timing difference . There was some information regarding a few of the metrics or a few of the initiatives that , uh , one team received , uh , and prepared the report for , uh , prepared the report a week ago , whereas there was another team that had more recent information , um , and was able to input that information and submitted it a week after the first team submitted it . So that's why , uh , we were able to find out . Yeah , it wasn't really as simple , uh , timing difference issue . We were able to address the problem . Uh , both teams now have the correct information and then our team , uh , was , was able to complete the executive reporting , um , before , well , we're still working on it , but we expect to complete it before the , this week's deadline .","Uh , so there was one particular time when I was at , uh , or was working as a auditor for a , uh , one of the big four accounting firms or audit firms , and it was at this time in which like , typically for new staff to assign just one audit , uh , and you're supposed to just focus on that one audit , uh , and complete the audit , uh , within the specified timelines . But then because of some staffing issues , uh , the firm was understaffed . So what happened was I ended up getting scheduled onto three audits at once , uh , as a relatively new or junior auditor . So , uh , immediately , like that was a very stressful situation . Like I , like one audit was already very complex , has really totally new . Um , but I , I guess what I did was like , try to embrace or understand the situation . Um , and even though it was very challenging , I felt like I'll be able to tackle it . And how I tackled it was , um , at least what I felt was the best approach was to sort of speak to all of the managers , uh , involved with three audits . I let them know like , Hey , um , I understand the staffing issues . Um , I am currently assigned on three audits , but I'll do my best to address the high priority items or high priority , uh , audit procedures that are required to completed , uh , and sort of meet the needs of all the teams as best as I could . So Bella's sort of like the first step I took , uh , just let being like having open communication , um , providing like very frequent status updates , uh , and let them know like that I'm working on three audits and that I'm focusing and prioritizing effectively . And I felt like overall , like I responded pretty well . Um , like , although , um , it was difficult to get all three audits done , um , before the deadlines . Like eventually they were all completed . Uh , and we were able to , uh , like meet or complete all the audits within the specified timelines or the specified deadlines . And the managers did recognize my efforts . Uh , they realized that I was put in a very difficult situation , um , given the staffing constraints . And , uh , as a result , I was recognized for my efforts and they , um , they let that let that known to me , uh , as part of the evaluation process at the end of the , at the end of the fiscal year .","So at the beginning of the year , one of the , uh , early career development commitments that I made was to research and look into Tableau . And Tableau is a data visualization and analytics tool . So it's used to , um , analyze large data sets and then it's able to visualize this data , um , into a very simple dashboard that people can easily look and understand . So , um , although this was like one of the commitments that I made , uh , there was a lot of , uh , additional projects and responsibilities that came in , um , that was assigned to my team as well as to me in particular . So what happened was I didn't have as much time than expected to look into Tableau , uh , which would be used to help , uh , I guess improve some of the processes within my current team . So as a result , what I did was I immediately let my manager know that , um , it was , uh , difficult to research and look into Tableau when there was a lot of additional tasks coming in , uh , were able to work on a plan so that I can focus on these , uh , tasks that came in that weren't in the original schedule , uh , and prioritize and try to knock those off first and then later on , uh , in April or may to start looking more into Tableau , uh , as a potential solution for some of our processes . So I felt that I took , uh , immediate action to resolve this , uh , or to inform my team as well as inform my manager , uh , about the difficulties in terms of keeping that career development commitment . Um , but I felt that I took the appropriate action as well as a sort of like a remediation plan to help , um , solve both the issues that were coming in that were unexpected as well as solving the issue of not being able to look into Tableau right away . Um , so I felt like it's still an ongoing , uh , topic , but I feel that as of right now , like I've made good progress on the , the unexpected projects that were assigned to my workflow . Um , and like during my spare time or before I , um , sort of end my day at work , I would try to like , do a little bit of Tableau research . I might read an article , I might read some resources that are provided on our company's internet sites . Um , so I feel like we're trending the right direction and like I'll be able to knock off those projects , uh , as well as start looking into Tableau . Maybe even like next week or really early in April .",4,4.25,4,3,3.75
94,P2q9abh-5pcg5d,"The first thing that comes to mind is , um , when I used to manage the deli at a grocery store , um , this is back when covert first hit in March of 2020 . And , uh , I'd say everyone was going through a complex and changing environment . Um , but it was especially difficult because we were dealing with food that has , um , spoilage . So it's very important to get the timing down . Um , so at this point we had a lot of workers who were out sick with Kobe . We had all these new restrictions including the amount of shoppers we had and we also had all these , um , supply chain shortages . So it was hard to get workers who were starting to get customers . It was hard to get the stuff we needed . Um , so basically I sat down with my fellow managers first at the grocery store and we collaborated on a , um , plan of how we're going to proceed next . We basically took stock of all our things and had a redo in our tire , uh , ordering a strategy and we went up , uh , coming up with a , a way to order stuff at a different times when I used to in order to better be parked demand .","Um , I'm thinking of my previous job where I worked as manager of a deli and essentially , um , our higher ups wanted us to get a complete remodel done . And while that remodel was happening , we still have to serve customers at the same capacity we had before . Um , so this was , this was going to be difficult cause it was hard enough to serve people . Uh , we weren't dealing with all this renovation stuff . So essentially what I did was I sat down with the technical people at my company and I helped set up an online ordering system . And this online ordering system , uh , was huge in decreasing , uh , the demand we have at helping us meet it during the remodel . Instead of having to watch people stand around and waiting in our take their orders , we could have , um , people order online beforehand that have employees off in a separate area preparing all their orders . So they were ready for when they arrived . This got rid of a lot of congestion , made customers happier , made employees happier and meant the bosses happier when we were able to complete the remodel while actually improving service .","I'm thinking of when the , um , pandemic for set back in 2020 . Um , there's a ton of conflicting information about how serious the virus was . B would be , what the repercussions would be , uh , physically , medically , uh , economically , socially . Um , and there's just a lot of different opinions about , uh , how soon everything would shut down and how soon we'll be able to get back to it . And essentially we had the decision , um , when the first lockdown started , if we are going to plan for this to be a quick thing that would be overall Sully shortly if we're going to be ready for it to be a long thing . And um , there were many people who thought it'd be short to make it without be long . It was hard to know who to believe . Um , this was very difficult cause I had to set our plans for the coming year and I'm going to plan 30 much different if we are going to be dealing with , uh , covert lockdowns for a year . Um , so I went up listening to a bunch of experts and doing a lot of research and determining that this covered epidemic was probably going to be on the longer side rather than the shorter side . So we managed to prep for that and it wasn't working out great in the long run .","I'm thinking about my current job where I may manage an insurance firm , um , a third of this job about four months ago . And , uh , it's going great now , but in the beginning it was extremely hectic and stressful . I was coming in on the heels of a , uh , the former manager had a , essentially a blown up and try and damage to the company on his way out intentionally , um , making work slower and , uh , harming the relationship with clients and employees . So when I came in , it was my job to fix that . And it's normally stressful enough to , uh , onboard to a new job like this . This was even worse due to all the baggage I had to deal with . Um , basically when I came in , I had to contact all of our clients and , uh , also all our employees and I sat down with every single one of them individually and just kind of gave them the lay of the land . I apologize for the previous behavior of the manager , but I let them know that with me coming in , this would be a reset and we need to prepare him for the future . And I was able to repair a lot of these relationships with the clients and with employees and turn the ship around and instead of losing a lot of people , a lot of them appreciated the honesty of me coming to talk to them .","Um , I've recently , I went back to school to get started on my , uh , engineering's master degree and I finished my education and I , uh , originally had started for a pretty aggressive school schedule because my current work schedule wasn't that bad . Uh , but then I very quickly , uh , had a great job opportunity come up , which I couldn't miss . So I left my job and joined a new job and this made it extremely difficult to get my schoolwork done . I went from , uh , frankly not doing much work to being busy all the time at my new job and I had to um , get through this semester without , uh , living my grades down or my self down personally . Um , I basically had to really buckle down and just make a strict , strict plan of how I was going to do all my schoolwork , how to skew all my other non work responsibilities for a while and just focus myself 24 , seven to school and worked . I wound up pulling through and succeeding and it was very rewarding for all the work .",2.666666667,3.333333333,2.333333333,2.666666667,3.333333333
95,Psyjsrw-aieya2,"A time where I had to adapt to a changing environment at work was definitely when our caseload's almost doubled . So my original kind of caseload was 25 and then there was a change in need for services as well as the change in management at the time . So I'm in caseload with doubled to 45 clients now . That was a significant change that I definitely had to adapt to a , I think one way in which I adapted was learning new time management skills . I had to really prioritize what was important for the day and then make my way down the to do list . Um , I had , I , I believe that was the biggest adaptation that I had to make . Um , and just really learning how to effectively allocate my time , um , for more clients .","So one of the projects that I was working on for my employer was compiling and analyzing the statistical background of our clients . So compiling information about their gender , their ethnicity , their religion , their , um , job , experience , education , et cetera for all our clients . So we have about 500 clients . So I had to break up that project into goals . So one of the goals was doing the research in the field , so making a survey , compiling it , sending it out to the clients , deciding which way to send it out , email or in person . So there's a lot of different details that I want into accomplishing each goal . Um , another goal was uploading all the data onto the computer and analyzing it myself . So that was the second goal that I had . A third goal is re organizing , um , the trends and the data into one , um , document that we can analyze . So overall , the project took me about two weeks and it didn't take as long as I expected and I was able to successfully finish the project . Um , and my data was , um , helpful in determining other interventions that we can use or resources with . Ease with the clients .","A situation in which I needed to make an important decision quickly . Oh , is faced with conflicting information included . When one of the staff members came up to me saying that one of the clients on my caseload expressed suicidal ideation saying they wanted to end their life . However , when I checked in with the client , they denied saying that . So I had to take upon myself to do , um , a suicide evaluation . Um , so I did an assessment myself . Um , and I also had to take in mind that sometimes clients will deny having suicidal ideation and be dishonest because they don't want to get sent out to the hospital . So , um , and doing my onsite assessment with the client as well as knowing their history from their collateral , I did decide that they were expressing suicidal ideation and , um , we did decide to take further interventions , um , including having increased contact with them , um , working and reviewing a safety plan with them , um , as well as reviewing coping skills and things they can , things and people they can turn to when they continue to have such thoughts .","I had to cope with a high pressure , stressful situation at work included when I was trying to check in with one of my clients on my caseload . Um , they were agitated . They were experiencing an increase in symptoms . And fortunately I did recognize that . So he physically assaulted me , um , by hitting me in the shoulder . That was pretty stressful because I've never been assaulted before , um , by that client . And I had pretty good rapport without clients . So , um , definitely was a high pressure situation . I didn't know if it was going to get worse . So what I did was analyze the safety in the room and realized how I can get staff assistance . I had my walkie on me , so I called for a code and they called for extra assistance . I looked for the nearest exit and , um , I was able to move myself from the situation of student staff that to , and were able to , um , ease and sooth the client , um , and deescalate the crisis .","A time when I experienced difficulty keeping a commitment due to other commitments at work included when my weekly outside supervision started conflicting with my weekly Sable educational groups that I facilitated on the unit . Um , this was because there was a change in my schedule for the new quarter . What I did was prioritize , which was most important , which was my weekly supervision . Um , and then also deciding what my alternative solutions were , such as to have to terminate , facilitating a group , or could I switch the group for another time , or can I switch groups with another , uh , individual working . So what I eventually did was finding out that I wouldn't be able to switch the group time . It wasn't as difficult as in process , I thought . So ultimately the outcome was that I was able to still go into my weekly supervision while also facilitating my group at a different time .",2.666666667,3,3.666666667,3.333333333,3
96,Pwu3ejj-8rbrpp,"It was right after nine 11 . Everything was shut down in my office and throughout the whole city . Um , we still needed business to continue , so we need makeshift offices . We quickly started gathering computers and setting up workstations . This was before people work from home or , you know , people had that kind of access . Um , I implicated and implemented , sorry , um , um , devices so that people could communicate . And we worked from all over , um , the outskirts of the city and got the job done .","I was in charge of setting up a new payment system for the front desk of our operations . And the day that , um , the equipment was to be delivered , there was a fire on the truck or equipment was not delivered . It was delayed . Um , we were supposed to go live . And , um , in any event , I set up a project so that we could hand-write things and put them into the new system when it arrived . And it worked really well . It was not easy and it was kind of scary , but we did it . It was , um , uh , pretty nerve wracking to say the least . But , um , we , we wound up taking care of it .","Again , this time was right after nine 11 . Our office was in New York city . Obviously we couldn't work there at that time for at least six months , and we knew that right away . Um , we weren't able to get mail , we weren't able to correspond . Um , so I made a decision to get an office across the river in Jersey city and we were faced with a whole bunch of obstacles . I was told one fee for , from the management company for rant , another fee from somebody else in the same office . So as my staff was moving things in , I was negotiating , um , rent prices under that pressure . Anyhow , it , uh , it did work out . Um , I informed my boss about the whole situation after the fact , after it was done and I did get the lower price . So all in all , it worked out well .","There was a straight in , um , right in front of our building , uh , one morning and nobody could cross the picket line , even though it wasn't our company that had anything to do with the strike . I needed to get into the office . I needed to get my staff into the office . So I kindly spoke to the security guard . He actually was very , very helpful . He called somebody in the union . I don't know who he called . And once we showed ID , each and every one of my staff was able to get into the building . It was unbelievable . I think he did it for a few companies because we're in the healthcare industry . I think he felt obligated since we had nothing to do with the company . That was striking .","Um , was invited to my niece's wedding out of town and at the very last minute , I needed to , um , stay at work and work through the weekend straight through .

97,Prbsjhf-dtgat4,"Okay . Uh , you know , recently , uh , with the , uh , pandemic , this is a perfect example , coordinating a large project , uh , that , uh , involved a lot of people from around the country , uh , was making sure they had what they needed to do . The project was going back and forth with them , keeping the project running and then the pandemic it , uh , so we went from a hundred miles an hour to zero miles an hour , uh , overnight basically . And so we had stopped the project , put everything on hold back things away , uh , you know , uh , reassess , uh , the way we were able to do things . We were losing people right and left , uh , as far as , you know , people being furloughed and laid off and things like that . So , uh , it , each day the job got trickier and harder because , uh , you were having to cover more , more things as you went along . So it was really a situation where we went from that fast speed of preparing a project to nothing . And then as the pandemic calmed down and , uh , you know , things started to get back to semi-normal , uh , we were able to then pick up where we left off and then slowly ramp back up and get the project running again , announced doing fine , uh , where we're able to do , to define with it . So I think anytime you're , you're doing project management work , you have to be able to be flexible . Uh , things change constantly , uh , worlds fast place anymore . So you have to be able to adapt and move with those changes .","Okay . Uh , at work , uh , where cost , we are project managers , uh , the people that I work with , it's a team of analysts and we are assigned different projects and we , we analyze and administer those projects . We have a certain set of people around the country that kind of work the projects for us . And the skill level of those people can change from time to time . So we had a project that , uh , involved some very technical , uh , new , uh , laws . And as part of that , we had to try to administer this project , uh , for people who were brand new to the job . We had just lost a large chunk of our people . They had all been promoted into another organization or another part of the organization . And when that happened , we were left with a bunch of people who did not have a lot of experience . And so because of that , we had to really , uh , take a project that was too hard for the people that we were having to give it to . And we had to train them . And , uh , we had to in some ways dumb the project down . Uh , to a point where they could handle it . And then when they started to get their feet under them , uh , we did site visits and we would go and help them . And , uh , we would answer questions for them . And if we saw a question that was a good question that , uh , needed to be used throughout the whole team as an example or a training moment , we would take a step back and gather everybody around and say , Hey , here's a great one that just came through . Let's talk this through and see how this should be handled . And on the backside of all that effort , we had a , a group that was ready to take the project and run with it . And we did that in five different sites around the country . And , uh , in each case it was , you know , there was a steep learning curve . Uh , but the people responded well and , uh , took to what , what we were giving them and , uh , allowed us to help them . And they've been successful at working .","Okay . For this one , uh , we have situations where , uh , and this , this happens almost weekly , we have to allocate resources really quickly , uh , to different priorities . And so those priorities can change , uh , very rapidly . Uh , we can , uh , it's , it's sort of a frustrating job in some ways . You can be headed in one direction . Everybody's moving in that one direction and all of a sudden a decision is made at the top . And not only do you maybe stop that direction , but you'll completely turn around and heading the other direction . So , uh , we get put in that situation , uh , frequently . So , uh , what we do is try to , uh , just move in the direction that we're supposed to be headed in , prepare as if that is the only thing that's going to happen . And then don't take any of it personally . If it all falls apart today , then tomorrow you come in and you work on the new thing . So , uh , we have that happen . That happened probably six times a month . So , uh , it , you know , the first few times it happens , there's a , there's a personal ownership to it where you're like , no , I've been working hard on this own to see it through . And you struggle with those sorts of things , but , uh , the longer you do it and the more times that you see it work out , you just start to lose some of that . And you go into it with the , the standard that I'm going to do my best job today on what they have me doing . And if tomorrow that changes and it's , uh , you know , backtracking in a way that hurts some of the things I've been working for for the last , uh , you know , six weeks or whatever . I'm just going to do that because that's what's good for them for the , uh .","Well , it seems like pressure's a constant in the workplace anymore . Some workplaces , probably more than others , but we're under pressure constantly . Uh , you know , we are , we are counted on to provide work for about 200 people around the country . If we don't do our job and we don't get that work , uh , delivered to them in time , then you have 200 people that the company is paying that are setting around doing nothing . So , uh , it's , you know , very critical for us to be able to do that . Uh , the covert situations . Another perfect example of this , we would have situations where one day we would have no one to provide work for and the next day with almost no preparation whatsoever , we would have to give work to 200 people . So , uh , we would plan things in advance . We would have scenarios running , uh , contingencies running . And then whenever the shoe drops , so to speak , we would , uh , fire the workout as quick as possible . We would try to have things that could be started quickly , ready to go at all times . And so then that way when , uh , you know , a surprise , so to speak , came up and people came back to work very quickly from , you know , change in statuses or something , we were able to get them back to work and being productive . Uh , almost .","Actually , I had to deal with this , uh , today , uh , at work . Uh , I've had an assignment that I've been working on a white paper and I've been working on it for about , uh , two weeks off and on and , uh , I was supposed to have it turned in today . And so out of the clear blue , we had an emergency pop-up and we were , uh , in a situation where we had to kind of drop everything we were doing and work on this emergency . So , um , I knew that that was going to affect the white paper and it was going to call some of it to be , uh , put on the back burner , but still had the deadline . Uh , boss is not particularly good at handling , uh , sudden changes like that . So , um , you know , basically to keep myself out of trouble and to keep both things on track . I just worked through lunch , I continued working on the white paper , uh , brought in a person , uh , to give me a little bit of information to help me with the white paper . So as we were continuing to work on , uh , the emergency situation , I was also working on the white paper and fortunately was able to turn in , uh , both by the end of the day . So that's , that's working in the modern world . You gotta be able to multitask candle pressure and keep moving , uh , regardless of the circumstance .",2,3.5,3,2.5,3.666666667
98,Pdje5n8-2c4i4n,"So recently , um , there were some changes at work where the product that I was mainly focusing on was put on pause , uh , for the rest of the year , um , until 2023 and we were all transitioning over to a new team . And so the main struggle there was basically like , we were so used to all the information at one project , we didn't have any idea of what to do for the next one . So personally the way I kind of adapted to the situation was first I found a point of contact on that project and really pick their brain on , um , what exactly my role would be in the team , um , and how I could best benefit the project . And then a lot of it came down to communication and just like doing research on my own and the internal , um , the project life cycle management , um , site , just looking through documents and just doing personal research to see if I can figure out as much as I can about the assignment I'd be working on specifically . Um , and then communication , a huge thing . Um , mostly just because you don't know everything . And honestly , going into new project , I didn't know anything really cause totally brand new to me . So asking a lot of questions and getting clarification on stuff was really , really big . And so that was , that was kinda how I am going about trying to succeed in my new role on this new project .","So I was thinking point on a project where basically I was the only person doing the work . I was running all the experiments , I was talking to the people at the manufacturing site and basically if something needed to happen , I had to push for it . And it was really difficult because I was a , I'm a new engineer and so it's kind of going out of my comfort zone to , to ask all these questions and to push people to get results and information . But I had to basically define what I wanted as my end goal and take the steps needed to achieve it . So I wanted to be able to resolve this issue . I wanted to come up with a solution that would be implemented and that would just resolve the issue . Um , with like a 95% confidence is what we were using to gauge a successful , um , experiment . And to do that I had to set up stuff for myself . So I had to , to go forward and reach out to , uh , suppliers to get parts that I needed to make a fixture . I had to test all the parts . Um , and I also had to basically write up all of the documentation for the experiment as well as the results and then present it to people and all this , it was new to me to do in a profession situation . So a lot of what I had to do was communicate with people who are more experienced to get a better idea of just making sure that I'm following the right steps . Um , the stuff I'm doing makes sense and it will help me get to my ankle .","So , uh , recently at work I was in charge of a project where I was determining , um , the root cause of a failure of a part and there were two higher up people who were giving me recommendations on what I should be doing . One of them was my direct team lead and then one of them was just someone that we had , um , was just advising us and both of them had conflicting opinions . And my honestly , my opinion was closer in line with my team leads . And it got to a point where every time I asked this other person for help , he would just tell , he would just give a bunch of information on stuff that didn't really matter . Um , and basically would just totally conflict with what my , uh , with what my team lead was saying . And so in the end I took his suggestions into account , but I didn't let them really affect my final decision cause I knew that what I wanted to do in the goals I wanted to achieve for that project or more in line with what my , my team lead was suggesting I do . Um , and he knew the project a little bit better . Um , it was more of an issue of that . The part was like an electrical component . And so we had a subject matter expert from the electrical team . Um , but we ended up going with my gut instinct and my team leads suggestion and it worked out well for us .","So one of the hardest times I had was during grad school . Um , I was interviewing for a bunch of jobs and I was also dealing with all my classes and I had exams coming up . So I had to basically prioritize , um , a very important interview and also study for my tests and perform on them so I can graduate with good grades . And the way I did this was basically just kind of compartmentalizing stuff . I broke these down into certain number of hour chunks and I dedicated those chunks to studying , doing stuff for my interview , um , taking exams , doing homework , um , eating , sleeping , everything and things . I just broke my entire day . I'd down into that and that worked very well for me just to have that structure . And it kind of took the stress away because it was kind of decided for me beforehand . I didn't have to kind of make decisions on the fly . So if I was studying for two hours and my cutoff came , I stopped what I was doing . I moved on to something else . And honestly , it ended up working very well for me just because I knew I had to finish everything in that two hour time slot or however many hour time slot . And it kept me focused and honestly , it did very well for me . Um , I did well on my interviews . I did pretty well on my exams . Um , maybe not as well as like a hundred percent , but maybe like , like a 90 , 90% . So it was , it was great . Um , and I still didn't really burn out . I was stressed , but it wasn't a bad kind of stress . Um , I felt good about myself cause I knew I was getting work done because of my sister .","So usually , um , if I ever have a conflicting commitments , um , I have to basically prioritize one or the other . Um , and the one that takes priority , um , there should be a pretty good explanation as to why it takes priority . Um , because I would need to explain that to whatever commitment I have to bail on essentially . Um , and I think the earlier you can communicate that to the person that you're , that you won't be able to attend . Um , the better just because if they need to make other arrangements , they can , um , either giving them a heads up so they're not really expecting you to be there on the day of . Mmm . And you should just give them good justification and apologize that you can't make it . And generally I've found that people are usually understanding of , of your situation . And if you have those kinds of priorities and you have , Mmm . If you have something very important that needs to get them .",3,3.666666667,3,3.666666667,2
99,Pz3pzyw-44vaa6,"In my current role as a consultant , I constantly have to adapt to changing and complex environment at work . Whenever I'm faced with a new and familiar environment at work , I always try to take a step back to try to take a holistic view and see the bigger picture to get a better understanding of the environment . Once I have a better understanding and has taken one or two weeks to generally get a better understanding of the work environment , then I would feel more comfortable as to uh , uh , doing my work , uh , at a , at , uh , at my expected pace , the best time . That's what I will give the example of when I started my current and new project around a month ago . Uh , we had completely different systems , completely different rules and the client had completely different expectations than the previous client that we were all very used to . Um , instead of just jumping straight in and making a lot of mistakes , like some of my fellow consultants , I took my time and didn't , um , forced the work immediately , is that I took my time to learn and have , get a better understanding of , through a lot of examples of how the client wants to work to be done . So I made sure that I took the right amount of time and even a little extra time after work to make sure that , have a better understanding and general grasp of exactly what's expected of me from the client . Uh , in that way , I was able to adapt to this changing environment really effectively and was able to , uh , pass QA better than my fellow , uh , consultants .","So in my current role as a consultant , we switched projects , switched between projects periodically and uh , most of the time we have to accomplish , uh , production targets . I mostly want to achieve . If not , I'll perform my fellow consultants . Uh , and I mostly have , we , I'll give the example of weekly , my director wants us to do at least eight cases per week , um , eight , eight cases and that's the standard minimum . Um , you have to hit this in order to reach the end of your week . So I usually aim for around 10 cases per week , even though most of my other consultant colleagues have told me that eight was really difficult to achieve . So I took the S the , I broke down the task into smaller steps in a way to , uh , effectively be able to manage the task uh , better . I broke down , I first did a time study to get a better understanding of exactly how long it would take a case for me to do . And after one or two weeks I had a better understanding of exactly how long it would take me per case . And after that I set goals to be able to try to shorten the , uh , in the ineffective steps in the project or the case . Uh , and I also have tried to minimize the , uh , analysis time in order to quickly shorten the time length that it would take . And I was able to achieve my goal of 10 cases per week by analyzing and breaking down the steps that it would take for each case and setting my and understand , getting a better understanding of the client's expectation , I was able to effectively achieve and surpassed the targets , uh , of my weekly performance goals that were sent to me by the director .","This brings me to a situation that occurred last week when the client , when our clients from the project returned , one of the cases that I was done , I completed a few weeks ago . Uh , they wanted to , they , the , there was a lot of conflicting information for me at the time because at the time , my director , my manager as well as the client and the client director has reviewed this case and they all had conflicting information as to what was the , what was the underlying , uh , problem and what needed to be resolved in the case . Uh , they all had different opinions . They all , so I had conflicting information from different sources even though I had my own idea . Um , and we needed to act on the decision quickly because the case was time sensitive at this point because it was already a few weeks in the works . So what I did was I sat down calmly and I've read through everyone's comments as well as everyone's , uh , information points . And then I gathered my notes and had and set up a meeting with everyone that reviewed the case . And then I went along to explain the exact situation of what I believe the case should have been , and then explained the situation to everyone where their notes were for were very constructive . But some of them I had to disagree with . Uh , so some , uh , in the end , after around an hour of that meeting , uh , I , I was very clear and elaborate as to my initial understanding and my initial , uh , issues with their , uh , uh , criticisms . So they were all able to come together . We're all able to come together and meet , uh , uh , a middle ground where we're able to get a better expectation of exactly what's the true reasoning should be for the case that I worked on . And I was able to come to a mutual agreement and , uh , everyone was happy at the end of the day .","So on a weekly basis , I have to deal with tight deadlines as well as uh , project goals and target that targets that I have to reach , uh , every week . Uh , it does come , it could come close and they are very stressful situations , especially on Fridays . So I'll go back to , um , a month ago , um , when it was around the first week of my project , it was the first Friday and we had to hit our weekly targets . Uh , it was a tremulous stressful because I haven't , I have around two cases left to hit my quota and it was , I wasn't anywhere near done . So the first thing that I did , uh , to respond to the situation was take a deep breath and take a step back to try to get a better understanding of exactly what the problem was . I then , uh , broke down the problem into smaller , more achievable tasks and steps and I wrote them all down into a notepad . After I wrote down into notepad , I started to chip away at the smaller tasks and small . And then I continued on to larger tasks and larger tasks and harder tasks . And then an easier task . And eventually , at the end of the day , I was able to do most , if not all of my tasks and was able to complete the entire , uh , task that I had to do or submitting two cases . So by the end of the day . So I think stress and pressure could be paralyzing , especially when it feels overwhelming . That's why whenever I feel stressed or pressured , I like to just take a deep breath and step away for a minute and they come back and analyze the task to see how I could make sure that I could break it down in order to be better able to reevaluate and see how I could make the task less stressful and more manageable for me . That's how I usually cope with stress at work . Uh , and it's done wonders for me .","There was a time around a month ago when I first started my new project is at the consulting firm that uh , I , I had a lot of trouble , uh , keep it hitting my production targets and hitting my target deadlines . Uh , and this was because I've made other commitments to work on , to finish up with the other project that we were , uh , we were wrapping up with another client . So that was the situation and my actions towards it was I took the time to explain to my director and my manager the exact situation and I had to compromise with them where I had to work exactly half a day on the whole project and half a day on the new project where I cannot do both for a full time commitment because I only have so many hours in my day . I was already doing overtime and I was extremely stressed because this new project had a steep learning curve , but the old project had to be finished by an exact deadline . So I made sure that I elaborated to my director and manager that I need a few more hours of overtime in order to be able to get a healthy balance of exactly how I could manage between two projects . And the outcome was I was able to achieve , uh , most of the targets from the new project and wrap up the old project successfully . And that was because I was able to compromise and be able to get more hours as well as , uh , get a better understanding to the director and manager that there w I was constructed based on two conflicting commitments . So proper communication and a good , uh , compromise was the way that I used to , uh , balance . Find a good balance .",3.333333333,4,3.333333333,3.666666667,2.666666667
100,Ppjg6uk-cjpgq6,"Alright . So a time when I had to deal with a complex , uh , work , um , uh , change or I have to adapt was when I , uh , when , uh , my workplace decided to , uh , amalgamate into a one office . So , uh , we were at the Saskatchewan , so we were like just part of the , we were our own office and then , uh , the headquarters in my company , they decided to amalgamate us and combine my province of Saskatchewan with the province of Alberta and put us all in one office . This has created a lot of change in the office . There was a lot of uh , change shifting and employees shifting in managers new positions , opening up and new opportunities opening up and so on . So , uh , this really created a big change . And in order for me to adapt as staff , as an employee for this , I had to really understand and I had to really ask a lot of questions . I did this by asking questions , asking the right questions that helped me understand exactly what's going on by going through with , um , uh , you know , with reading about the changes , understanding what the changes really mean . Looking at the changes in a positive perspective and trying to , uh , express my negative thoughts and my , uh , the difficulties that I'm going to face and then trying to overcome those and looking for ways to solve those issues . So the way I look at it is , uh , first of all , I would want to look at things from a positive perspective . And then when there is no positive , uh , you know , when I look at the positive perspective , there's also going to be some difficulties , some negative negativities that I would come across . And for those difficulties and negativities , what exactly I'm looking for is I'm looking to , um , what I look for is I look to first recognize the problem and then find a solution for the problem . So it's very important . What I want to come to at the end is in any change , there's always positives that we can always consider . But what we never talk about is the negatives . And I feel like we should always express those negative feelings , those negative things that we think about any change , and then come up with a plan to tackle those negative things .","So in my last , uh , in my last position as a auditor , we have to finish a specific number of files or specific number of views . And in my company we were running out of budget . So we really had to set goals , uh , for employees and order for us to meet those budget targets before the end of the budget . And then those targets were , you know , were , they seem to be unachievable , but we wanted to set a plan to either get as close as possible or to achieve those targets . So what we looked at is we wanted to see what causes employees to be behind in their work to finish files less quickly and we want it to come up with solutions . So , um , what I did was I first met with , you know , I met with other people in the office just so I understand exactly the root cause of the problem , what each employee was expected to finish . So like , let's say each employee on average was expected to finish this number of falls in order for them to meet the budget , the budget that we set at the beginning of the year . And what each employee on average was lacking and why they were lacking these things . So we , uh , we came up with , uh , uh , you know , statistical numbers and then we decided to use those physical numbers to come up with qualitative ways in order for us to improve the work environment for employees in order for them to improve . So one of the things we realized is that employees really dependent on supervisors . And then if there were less supervisors available , then , uh , their work would not be done as quickly . So we came , uh , we changed the ratio of employees to supervisors from 10 to one to eight to one , which would increase the , uh , which would put less pressure on the supervisor so they can approve more files , answer questions quickly , and then employees can always reach the supervisor more quickly so they can finish pause quickly . Another thing we did was we tried to identify , uh , trading issues that we have . So if there were employees were getting training that they do not necessarily need that , we can skip on that . And , uh , we were able to identify fused few areas there that we could , uh , we could skip and in order for us to , uh , provide for better training for better , uh , overall , uh , environment for employees or for them to work to work better , this caused an average increase . So we were looking for an average increase of 10 falls . They calls an average increase of five falls per , uh , per employee , which was still a really positive thing , and it really was really a positive change for the next year's budget as well .","So , uh , in one of my falls as an auditor , I faced an issue as similar to these tuition described where it was me looking to get information . So I was looking to get information , uh , from , uh , you know , from different sources I wanted to get information for . I was getting information from different sources . So I would get information from an external party , I would get information from the client and then I would get information , like internal information that we have and uh , information that we would , uh , and then I would have to like compare all three information to come up with a conclusion whether there's an adjustment needed , whether there's no adjustment needed and so on . So one of the situations that I found was , is I was getting conflicting information from a third party and the client and I needed to come up with a conclusion for who is more reliable . So what I wanted to do is I wanted to go to the basics and when we go to the basics of an accounting audit is what's the most reliable source of information . And the most reliable source of information is always the , uh , external party information that you get . So I wanted , so I came back to my roots and I came back to the conclusion that yes , this is the most reliable information . This is what I'm going to use and this is going to be what I will use for basis for my , uh , audit there . Uh , and then the other thing is I wanted to communicate this with the client . So me communicating this with a client , I knew it was going to be a tough conversation to help the clients , especially with the fact that there's conflicting information . But what I did was I really took my time . I really made sure that I know all the facts and I really construct some really good conversations . So what I did was basically I went back to the basics and I just simply practice how to deliver this information to the client . Cause this was the most difficult thing because I had the conflicting information and I had to choose one of over the other , which I made the decision of based on the accounting rules and the audit rules that we have in place . And then I had to just communicate this with the client . So practicing the communication with the client , expecting different scenarios , different ways that the client could counter or can argue back , uh , really helped me be prepared for the conversation and deliver that , uh , communication message with the client , which ended up going , uh , smoothly and , uh , by , uh , you know , stating facts and nothing but facts , you know , it was a , and then , you know , explaining the facts . It was really easy for the client to fully understand exactly what's going on .","So one of the most pressure times I had at work was , um , I was a very high achieving employee and I was doing very well . Then I was , uh , surprised with the change that I will be going to a different team and I will be working with a different supervisor even though I had a really , really good relationship with my current supervisor and I was one of the highest achieving employees , I think , you know , office-wide as well as , uh , in my team I was the highest achieving employee and me and my supervisor or previous supervisor had really good situation , really good relationship going on . So what happened is that , uh , it's me switching my supervisor . My new supervisor simply did not like the way I do work . Did not believe that I was that good of an employee and really was really critical of my work and was really , uh , uh , showing , you know , making it difficult for me by , uh , making approval falls very hard and not allowing me to , uh , do any , any , any , anything to , uh , like improve or providing me with helpful feedback to improve . This was a really difficult situation who put me in a really difficult situation and put me in really tough times , or I could not really , uh , cope well and I was not doing well and my performance would it go down , uh , would go down as I was not motivated to work . Uh , so what I needed to do is I needed to respond . I needed to react to this . I need it to , or , you know , I probably could have proactive , but I didn't know that I could have , that I was going to face such situation , especially coming from such a good team environment to a new team environment . And my approach was communication for like communication was key there . Uh , yeah . I sat down with my new supervisor . We , uh , talked to our differences . We talked about what I can do to improve what I can do to , uh , in order for me to achieve , uh , the , uh , optimal results that he's really looking at , uh , that will , uh , end up putting me in a good position for work , uh , through communication . But , and then in this communication , we set up a plan . And the , uh , outcome was great . Since I actually got to learn from his perspective , I got to learn new ways of doing things . And then , uh , it was difficult at the start , but I felt like , you know , looking at it from a positive perspective , I'm learning new ways of doing things and becoming a much better employee overall and much better accountant , which really helps and really helped me improve .","Uh , so a time where I made a commitment and I was not able to , uh , do or , uh , you know , achieve , uh , go by my commitment , uh , was , um , you know , when it comes to achieving the target for each employee . So I had a target to achieve a number of falls to complete my job and I was not able to meet this commitment that I made at the beginning of the year when meeting with my supervisor , uh , to complete those , that number of files . Um , you know , uh , what happened was that I was involved in some training and , uh , I was offering training to newer employees and so on , which caused me to be delayed . It caused delays for me and it caused me to not be able to complete , uh , the amount of files that I needed to complete . Um , uh , you know , the , the situation was that I needed to achieve a 102 falls completed in the year and only completed 82 files . Uh , so what I did was , is that I , uh , um , I created like a budget , a time sheet or I created like an Excel sheet that showed , uh , the time I spent training new employees , which would have put me away from finishing falls , what the average number of hours needed to complete a file and how many false training put me behind . Uh , this has really made it easy for me to present to my supervisor , uh , during the performance review . Uh , why I did not achieve that number of files . And it was very easy for my supervisors to understand and for easy for my supervisor to see exactly what went on . Uh , you know , given like , let's say I need 75 hours to train a new employee to , uh , to complete all their onboarding and teach them how to do the job and the number of employees , uh , I had , uh , and then how many falls I need to finish many hours I need for a file and how many files I could have finished if I was not doing this ? And how many files hours away , uh , directly and indirectly because of this really helped , uh , my case , make my case strong . And my supervisor was pretty happy with the explanation . And , um , you know , I summarize this , I would say it was all about like this tablet , but of facts that cause this to be an easy , easy things to , an easy thing to explain .",4,4,3.333333333,3.333333333,3
101,P99mgq7-g5xmv5,"That came January of 2020 I was a project manager for an initiative around improving the courtesy of inbound and Alvin forecast that our business intelligence team was providing to different of our distribution centers . Doing this require a lot of brainstorming and why boarding sessions that benefit from being physically on site . Obviously as you know , in just the span of two months , we had two entering to lock down and all of our work , one from being onsite to remelt . This proved to be a very challenging situation , not only because of the unknown of what was happening back in the day , but also on the way that we were used to work . I took the lead on trying to understand what were the main hurdles that every single team member was facing and how we can address them effectively through a new way of working . Now , I'm not going to say that it was easy because at the first two , three weeks we were in very in adaptive mode and very worried about what it was going to happen outside of our professional lives . However , in month two we started seeing over the song results . Um , our project was able to continue within the project timeline that we initially established and our team members felt that the initial , um , challenges that they voice have been correctly . I trust this increased engagement and also increased our overall sense of belonging as a team and in a very special way allowed us team to work in a very , uh , closed leap , uh , matter . Our project was sexually deployed and we were able to achieve the results that we initially wanted . However , I think the main benefit that we were able to extract from this is that many , our project teams just started using the blueprint that we establish and help our team , our supply chain team to start using , um , kind of like a template that was already addressing the main common pain points that our teams will be facing . I started giving all pretty speeches and some coaching to our teams that were going through the same things that we want at the beginning , and proved to be a very successful thing that now that we're going back into onsite , we're going to be certainly leveraging and it's going to allow the work , uh , for an iPad , um , and for remote work killers to continue using in our organization .","I was entrusted with delivering a micro fulfillment center in Alberta of last year . This happened around may of 2021 and this I needed to be up and running before Tobar of 2021 this means that we only had five months to be able to deploy this slide . However , when looking at the work stream and everything that needed to be deployed , it was fairly clear that the workload translated into over seven months of work easily . We were able to see that we were already two months behind . What I did initially was to try to understand what were the non key deliverables that we could postpone and what were the key things that we definitely needed to have on site up and running before timber . This allows us to prioritize workload and at the same time try to focus on what was more important versus not . Although this didn't help to shave much of the time that we didn't have allow us to definitely have a good roadmap that we could follow . The second step that I did as well was to put a very aggressive timeline and I tried to equate a data one with the key resources that would be available to travel back and forth between Ontario . I don't pro now . I was very open with the team members that were going to be deployed on site because the plan to be able to catch up and make up for the time that we didn't have require them to be working up to 16 hours every day Monday to something . I was very transparent in my communication and try to let them know that if they were not comfortable doing this for an extended period of time , they always had the opportunity to be able to step up . I believe the fact that I was also joining their own side for the majority of the project deployment helped them to feel encouraged and inspired by seeing that our leader working and rolling up their sleeves next step . At the end of the day , what we sell is that we were able to deploy this site within the timelines that we originally wanted and we felt a sense of accomplishment because everyone that was at the beginning involved in this said that this was impossible . And everyone at the end of the day said that somehow we made things possible possible . Now this goes without saying that we definitely put a lot of stress and pressure into our teams . So I provided an a specifically a good amount of rewards and time off and drains December as a reward for all the individuals that went above and beyond on delivering this site . Finally , the lessons learned that we were able to capture from this will allow us to keep doing the version two of this type of site for this year without a have each run on the same kind of risks and pressures for our team members .","Last year I was in charge of building our first reverse hub in our Canadian network . It was very important to have this inside deploy because the amount of returns that we were receiving from customers was going exponentially . One of the things that we needed to deploy it on the side to have it operationally was obviously metalwork . We didn't know much about network . However , we knew what it was going to be , the setup for workstations , what it was going to be , where it was going to be , the location for the network room and that translated into the type of cables that we needed and the luck because of Kobe , there were significant supply chain disruptions that affected the delivery of the cat five cable that we initially procure . The supplier offer us an alternative which contemplated a premium , but it was an upgraded cable to cat seven . Now I'm going to be super honest , I didn't know the difference between the two and I did a quick research that had a lot of conflicting info . On one end it said that the premium is worth it and that it will support a longterm operations . On a site like ours , but in order , it's like if our organization was already using kind of five that it was no need to upgrade in the foreseeable future because I had to deal between going over budget or having a site that was not ready by the timeline that we had initially proposed . I had to do a little bit of a digging and I went to one of our experts on networking organization to get a little bit more clarification on what was the difference between the two . After getting a little bit of invalidation that there was not going to be any negative impact in our operations and broader , it was just going to be at premium . I ended up taking the decision of going with a concept and despite the conflicting information , I , I firmly believe that it was more important to have our site up and running rather than not having anything at whole . While everything else and all of the training that was happening was already in place . My decision ended up helping our organization to start receiving returns and being able to process them in a way that improve our net promoter score for returns . And at the same time allow us to deploy one week ahead of scuttle despite the fact that we were already over budget , my managers hadn't sponsor . So the , the tradeoff that I did was write one and actually encourage me to continue making decisions that were always tailored to improve the customer satisfaction and none necessarily . Um , I'm being restricted by the fact that this could affect the project budget .","by default gets bored rather quickly and loses engagement and interest on activities that are very repetitive or are not intellectually challenging . And therefore I always tried to be engaged in projects that are very stressful and have a lot of high pressure , just keeps me going and allows me to enjoy the full life cycle of specific project . However , last year I signed up for something that was um , a little bit outside of my comfort zone . Me and our project team members were working 16 hours every day from Monday to Sunday for almost four weeks , four months . And Paul though I was enjoying a lot of work and it wasn't a situation that kept me engaged . This translating into me making significant trade offs between the project that I was delivering and also my day to day work as a project manager for other projects , I was let me see meetings , I was sometimes losing track of deliverables and obviously my work was being significantly affected by because my attention was mostly on the project that I was onsite . I had to come up with a viable solution that allow me to do what I was doing while keeping track on everything else that I was also accountable and responsible for it . I took one weekend off on my craziest kill while I was coming back home and define what are the key things that I could delegate to our team members , what was going to be the right schedule for me while it was going to be on site , but at the same time paying attention to everything else that was happening in Otter locations or audit projects and I came up with a good plan that will allow me to be able to continue to service my team while continue looking and overseeing the project that I was going onsite . This helped me to be able to mitigate as much as could the risks that I was facing at the beginning , and also allow me the opportunity to , instead of looking for high potential individuals across my team and that I could start delegating more and more responsibilities . This encourage other individuals as well to raise their hands for getting more of the work that I was willing to give and allow our team to feel more engaged in the work that they were doing . Now , I think one of the key outcomes and results of this is that does that allow us to come up with a new way of working where people were taking more responsibilities than what they will usually do before , and helping to address one of my key opportunities to improve , which is delegating more to our team members . Oh , let's continue . I was able to continue to join my work remotely and on site in a span of three weeks and being able to come up with the results that I was mentioning in the first month of me going out there .","As part of my efforts of being an inclusive leader , I made a commitment almost three years ago that any new hire is within my team , what are , they will be reporting directly to me or not . That will be dedicating at least two to three sessions or in their first four weeks to be onboarded by me where I can share my experiences with the organization , my perspective , battle things , priorities , objectives , and just getting to know them a little bit better . I think this has proved to be very successful on their overall onboarding experience and their engagement with the team . Because last year was a very competitive year in our industry . I had a lot of competing priorities that took me away from my regular day to day . I was traveling quite a bit and I started losing track of this type of meetings . One of my direct reports reminded me that there was an individual that was already on his fourth week and that I haven't had an opportunity to meet with uh , with him . Uh , during our scuttled cynical , I was obviously called out in a very good way , which reminded me that I was losing track of my commitment and the , and it , this was negatively impacting the experience of new hires . I tried to make up for the time that it was lost , but obviously , um , it was going to be challenging because of my current agenda . What I did was trying to just cuddle a cold that it was outside of working hours with the individual that I haven't had an opportunity to meet . I tried to look for a time and place that work with , uh , with this particular individual and was very transparent in terms of what uh , what was the reasoning behind me not being able to keep my commitments . I believe that he appreciated me being transparent and honest and actually propose different alternatives that would work for the both of us . We ended up actually meeting in person in one of my trips back home and we had an opportunity to have an hour long chat over coffee . That I think was one of the best experiences that I have had , uh , since school started . And onboarding new interpreters . I think as a result of this , one of the key learnings that I had was that it's always great to keep commitment , but at the same time , if something else is in jeopardy , wising that to act quickly or to always have an open door policy with anyone so that they can actually call you out . The way that I was called out and reminded that I was not , um , meeting my side of the commitment . I had a very wonderful experience . What this new hire and I'm sure and positive that he had one as well .",4,4,4,4,4.333333333
102,Pzpxje2-efgw9n,"I was recently put in a position where my manager at work took on a new duty and I was left without a manager to specifically guide me through my work . So it was just on a temporary basis , but it was long enough so that it was going to be kind of a consistent part of my daily routine for at least a few months . So I knew that I was still going to be held accountable for the same jobs , the same milestones , but without somebody there to help serve on the day to day basis , something that I used to have . So I still , I still knew I was going to be working kind of at the same pace with the same weekly , daily , even monthly responsibilities . So what I did is I reached out to some other project managers that were in the same team as me , and I talked with them about steps that I could take to make sure that I could still progress effectively and that I could hold myself to the milestones and timelines that I knew I needed to meet . So the main takeaway from that was just some organizational lessons hold myself to some little , a little bit of a stricter standard . And I think talking with these people really helped me , um , have a more global view of my work , not just kind of stuck in the day to day tasks like I had been working and it really helped me focus more on the bigger picture . Um , I was still able to reach my goals . I was still able to form my tasks as needed , um , but focusing a little bit more on the macro rather than the micro . And even though it's a little bit nerve wracking to have that person absent , I think it was beneficial really for me and for my team to have that experience of holding ourselves , um , kind of reaching a little bit , holding ourselves to those higher standards . And we all were able to get everything done that we needed to . And I think we also learned a little bit and were able to push ourselves to perform at a higher level .","I had a project that I knew was going to be difficult to pull together for several reasons . It required the collaboration and coordination of several people among many business units across different time zones , living in different States all across the country . It was going to take a significant amount of work planning and research . And at the end of this project , I was the one responsible for collecting all the information , analyzing it , assembling it , and putting it into a final presentation format . So I knew I had this project that I was responsible for . Um , there were parameters that were within my control , however , picking a due date and picking certain milestones to be reached within the project timeframe . So the way I approached this was , you know , considering my timeframe that I had to work within , but also looking at the various people that I was working with and trying to understand the logistical limitations that were things that are just barriers that have to be worked within , but also different personalities , different work styles , uh , things of that nature . So putting together those pieces , what I was able to do is communicate with each team , reach out very early , try to get an understanding of when people thought that they could provide deliverables to me and then make my timeline something that was concrete . And once I had that and once I had everybody's buy off , everybody was aware of what needed to be done . And when I set up , um , and even more specific timeline timeline for myself to reach out to people , reach out to people at specific and our goals to figure out where they were in their process , if they needed help , if they needed further assistance , if they had questions . And also at every step of the way , leave a little bit of wiggle room for corrections , for discussion , for things to change . So putting together all those pieces allowed me to prepare my big picture for the final deliverable and I stayed with it . I know that , you know , checking in on people too often can be seen as a burden , but also if you phrase it the right way and you're offering help and assistance and making sure that you want them to be successful , then people are very receptive to that . So with this strategy , you know , people who respond quickly right away can get that information . That's great . People who might need a little bit more time or a little bit more assistance , that's also accounted for within this timeframe . So I was able to get the information that I needed plenty of time for review , was able to get my deliverable done , and everybody felt supported along the whole way . And the presentation was a success .","I was recently working at a client site and I was working on one specific project when the client came up to me and had a question for me about something unrelated and I was not anticipating discussing this at that particular time . But of course I'm always willing to address questions and concerns whenever they come up . And the client asks me about something that I had some previous information about some knowledge about , um , internally from my employer . And then the question that they asked me along with the information that they provided wasn't exactly in line with what I had already been told . However , I was sitting there in front of them . And you know , my part of my responsibility is to be able to discuss issues with them as they arise . So faced with this , faced with the question that I was being asked and I was , they were wanting an answer for me on the spot , which is acceptable . That's part of what I do . And you know , the way I approached it was to take the information that they were providing to me , understand , really understand what it was that they wanted from me . And also in the back of my mind , I had the information that I had already been provided and I listened to them . I asked clarifying questions , I got to the bottom of what it was that they really needed . And I was able to come to a conclusion and offer a solution that I think was a compromise between the information that I had and the information that they were telling me . Um , but the most important thing was that I was honest with them and I S and I was able to say , you know , I haven't spent a lot of time on this issue yet . I have received some information and I want to be able to serve your needs in the best way . So I think that with what I know right now , I think we can go down path a and I think that that's what you guys are asking me for . But I will say that there may be some other information yet that I'm not aware of or you're not aware of . So we're , I will want to go back and check this information and then I'll get back to you so that we can solidify , um , what's been said in this conversation . So again , um , bottom line approach is always acknowledging what I'm hearing and making sure it's known that I understand what I'm hearing . But also being honest , I , I think being honest is the most important thing . Making the best decision in the moment with the information that I have . Always leaving it open to go back and verify that if additional facts come up , if other information is made known , it may be necessary to revisit the solution or revisit the answer .","The most high pressure and stressful situation that I have been in recently was a meeting that I was involved in that involved my team , high level executives from my side and also a high level executives from a client side in this meeting was a really important meeting that had a lot of information that needed to be presented in a very logical manner . And there were many people from my side that had to take part in this presentation . I had to manage the whole process as well as field questions and had to keep it running smoothly . So from a logistical standpoint , it was on my shoulders , but also from just making sure , uh , the information had been prepared , um , in , uh , in the best , most logical way . So it was very nerve wracking to make sure that everything went smoothly , but also to make sure that the information was relevant and practical and the information that was what everybody was hoping to hear out of this meeting . So to help prepare for this situation , to help kind of get myself ready , um , I just practiced . I got myself up to speed on everything that I needed to know . I , you know , kind of talked to myself and reminded myself the purpose , the purpose and intent of the meeting . Um , which was to inform everybody , um , get people up to date on status , uh , you know , inform people of the information that's most necessary to answer questions , um , and also to prevent questions on the part of the client to make sure I'm anticipating the information that they want and to provide it . So I kind of went through a checklist , got myself prepared , thought of any questions that could come up , answered them and just ran through it . And once I satisfied myself that I could meet those goals and meet those standards , it took away most of the stress and I knew exactly what I needed to say . I knew exactly the order it was going to be said . I knew how to address questions if they came up . Um , I felt prepared . So feeling prepared is what was able to ease most of the anxiety and stress . Uh , and I just knew , you know , I can counter anything that comes up . I am able to answer any question that comes up , so there's no need to be nervous . The anxiety comes from feeling like I might stumble , but if I have prepared myself appropriately and I am self-assured and I know what's I'm going to present , then there's no need to feel stressed or anxious .","Recently , I was tasked with an acting management assignment , which meant I had to fill in as manager for a group while somebody was on leave . But I also had to maintain my current workload . And this meant that my , all my normal normally scheduled meetings and commitments still had to be tended to . And at this time I had to take on several new meetings and assignments due to this acting manager assignment . Um , it was really important for me to make sure that my existing casework was , uh , attended to and that it didn't fall behind and that it didn't slip through the cracks . There were a couple of pretty large , um , meetings that needed to be dealt with and needed to be led and managed . But I also had some important assignments due to having to fulfill this manager role . So looking at the best way to keep commitments . I weighed the pros and cons of finding somebody else to fill in for me , for example , on my existing work . So there were a couple of meetings where even though I had already previously committed to them , I weighed the benefit or the cost to getting somebody to stand in for me . Somebody who had knowledge of the cases already had knowledge of the information that needed to be disseminated and tried to find somebody to take over my responsibilities and if I felt comfortable that that could be done and then there would not be , um , any lapse in progress or any drop in , um , quality , then I was comfortable making that decision . So there were two cases in which I was comfortably able to give the role to somebody else who I thought would do more than sufficient and taking over for me . And not only that , I think it's a great opportunity for somebody else , um , to step up and improve their ability in that role . So , even though I had made those prior commitments and I had new opportunities for myself and new , uh , commitments pop up for me , um , I think that it is okay sometimes to find new people or new ways to cover those tasks , especially if you're able to create new opportunities for somebody else and somebody can step into that role . So in my case , it worked out just fine . I found somebody able to cover for me just fine , and everything went extremely smoothly and even better , that person was able to gain some additional experience and I was able to complete my , um , manager role without , without any roadblocks .",4.333333333,4.333333333,3.666666667,3.333333333,4.333333333
103,Ppnv5nt-729ubh,"I worked for an online retailer of music . It was sort of like iTunes , but before I tunes , I had been around for a long time . And , uh , as such , the , uh , business had evolved several times , uh , over the course of a couple of decades . Um , and when I was hired there , I was hired for one specific role , uh , which was to manage , you know , a particular department within the organization . Um , but as the business shifted , again , we had a change of leadership , um , and different priorities sort of , uh , you know , one of those pivots . Uh , so the business pivoted a bit and , uh , we ended up launching an entirely new division . Um , and my role changed quite dramatically to become , uh , the lead marketer for that new division that was being created a whole cloth . Uh , so I was really involved in , you know , I wasn't involved in the specific business decision to create that department , but I was involved in all of the decision making around , you know , the naming , the marketing , the how we were positioning this department , uh , how we were going to sell this product . Um , you know , I became involved in each of those steps , um , and ended up with a very successful launch working with a small team that I was involved in the hiring of , uh , so , well outside the range of , of what I had done before . But I , I stepped up and worked with the team that we had to put together , you know , a new staff and work with a new staff to , to successfully launch this new product , uh , which was very well received by our customers .","In my most recent position , uh , I was responsible for email marketing , um , marketing overall , but email of course falling under that . And when I , when I took on the role , um , the organization that I was working for had a fairly low record of , uh , engagement with their email products . Uh , so there was an email newsletter and then sort of sporadic , uh , marketing emails , you know , special messages that went out via email , et cetera . And they all had a really low engagement rate , really low click rate , really low open rate . And so I was tasked with fixing that or making them , you know , raising those metrics . Um , I took a number of steps , identified a number of different issues with the email , um , from the content that we were sending out to the vehicle by which we were sending them . I implemented a complete change of our email marketing service provider , uh , which involved , you know , specking out a multiple new service providers , getting pricing negotiations , all that , uh , as well as changing the content , um , testing out new emails and cadences , new subject lines , new content , um , new targeting , all different , uh , axes along which we could measure success . Um , you know , I set a goal for myself to increase the open rate and the click rate , um , over the course of a year and managed to do so , you know , substantially substantially increased the open rate , um , to a place where it was performing at about , you know , 75% better than it had been when I first began within the job . Um , and had some really big successes with the new service provider . Uh , and overall it was a very complex project . It was a goal with a lot of different elements to it . Um , but I felt like we really were able to achieve quite a lot over the course of that year .","In one of my previous positions , I worked in , um , academic publishing . Um , and one of the key , uh , uh , events or set of events in that industry are conferences . Um , there are generally , uh , a number of conferences that , you know , professional conferences that happen over the course of the year that are places where publishers can go to cultivate new authors , learn about , you know , subjects that may make for important , um , publications later on , sort of build a network , build relationships and network with existing authors and so on and so forth . They're , they're kind of the main development , um , opportunities for , for the industry . Um , to where I worked , obviously there was a limited budget and , uh , the decision of which conferences to attend was always a very contentious and complicated process . So , um , when I , in in my position , I had to make some decisions between which conferences to attend . Um , they all have , you know , sign up dates and , um , deadlines and fees that need to be paid to attend travel that needs to be booked and all that stuff . And I was in a situation at one point where there were , um , a couple of different events happening on the same , on the same dates . And you know , the marketing team thought that it was best to attend one of them . And you know , the editorial team thought that it was best to attend another one and it sort of came down on my shoulders and I had to sort of way which , which of the events , which of the conferences I thought was the most , uh , had the most potential for not only sales of our existing products but also , um , the cultivation of new products both in that sort of networking and identifying new subject matter , et cetera . Um , and you know , I can't know exactly whether the other conference would have been , uh , more successful cause you know , we had to choose one and go with it . Um , but then when I chose was really successful , uh , we had great sales there and also had , um , some made some great new connections with authors who turned out to be very prolific for us . Um , so it felt like it , while it's impossible to know exactly , it certainly felt like a , a successful decision on our part .","In my most recent position , um , uh , I was hired in March of 2020 , um , March 1st , which , uh , was right before , um , the covert pandemic , uh , became an issue here in the U S uh , so a lot of my early on the job , uh , training I guess you would say happened through the lens of dealing with the pandemic . Um , that organization is a nonprofit organization that specifically , um , aim to help a subset of , uh , workers who are inordinately affected by the pandemic . Um , and so a lot of our work was in response to those issues . Um , helping our constituency , uh , deal with the situation , understand the situation , um , and trying to secure , uh , resources for them . Um , specifically I'm thinking of a moment where we had access to , um , Senator Chuck Schumer who was , um , an advocate for us and we had the opportunity to sort of host a video event with him , with our organizations , uh , leader . And , um , I was tasked with , uh , setting it all up , finding a service through which we could , um , do the video presentation to a large group of people . Um , manage the sort of questions and answers from our , it was sort of like a live town hall . Um , and so it was on me to figure out how to make it all work . Obviously dealing with the pressure of the senators , time and staff being very cognizant of making sure all the details went well , making sure that he , you know , was presented well . Uh , also dealing with , um , you know , the input from our constituents who were panicking , uh , confused , full of questions , um , and sort of managing to put all those together into an event that was , uh , useful and helpful to them and made a good use of the senator's time .","I used to have to do a lot of , um , business development and client relations . Part of my position was , um , establishing partnerships with businesses and organizations to present , uh , their products to , uh , our audience and our customer base . Um , and we signed a number of different agreements , uh , with varying companies to present their products . Uh , the goal was to have , um , one partner in each sort of area , product area , so as not to have , you know , competition amongst our partners . So , you know , part of my job was to identify the best , uh , product or service in a specific area that we would then , you know , cultivate a partnership with , sign an agreement to present their products to , to our audience . Um , what that meant was there were often cases where I had multiple conversations with multiple different companies or organizations in the same field or offering the same kind of product , um , and had to determine which was going to be the best fit for us . And there was one situation , I'm thinking of specifically where , uh , you know , I had a series of conversations with , uh , one organization , um , met with their team , talked about what the partnership would look like , had a really good rapport with them and established a great working relationship to start out . Um , and then at the 11th hour I was presented with , um , my , uh , executive directors , uh , choice for a product in that same field , um , which was a different company . So he had independently identified a different company and had conversation with them and decided that that was the direction we were going to go . And I had to break the news so to speak , to , uh , the company that I had been working with . Uh , and unfortunately kind of go back on the commitment that had been made . No contracts had been signed , but you know , verbally we , we discussed that this was , this was going to move forward and I had to go back to him and express my regrets . Um , you know , let them know that , that my organization had decided to go a different way . And , you know , it's , let them know that it wasn't due to anything that they'd done , that it was , this new opportunity was , was deemed to be beneficial for other reasons , and , uh , keep the relationship good .",3.666666667,3.5,2.666666667,3.333333333,3
104,Pafx5sj-gdagdp,"Okay . A time when I had to , um , adapt and , uh , change , uh , midstream was , I was running an audit engagement and there were six members on the team and I had already assigned everybody , you know , tasks they were going to do . So , um , fast forward , one of the members got pulled off of our team to go help out on another client team . So what I then had to do was reassigned tasks , redistribute , so that it was keeping in mind that I wanted it to be fair . Um , you know , not overwhelm any one individual . And also , uh , I took on more work , but , uh , we stayed within budget , which is what I wanted to do . So everything worked out .","Okay . A time when I had to that I set goals for a project that was hard to achieve , um , was once again on a client , um , review . Uh , we were having issues because they were accrual basis for accounting purposes and there were cash basis for taxes and it was the first time that we were working on those clients . So I had never , um , you know , convert it accrual to , to cash basis or purposes of tax before . So it was challenging cause I had to find out how to do it and then teach my team members how to do it because there were multiple companies involved . Um , but once I was able to get the method down , it went pretty smoothly to showing my team members how to do it . So all worked out . But .","Okay . Um , a time that I was faced with conflicting information and I had to make a decision . Um , once again , it was a client . They needed , um , financial loans from a bank . And I was in the process of creating their financial statements . And there was a , one of a couple of ways to interpret , uh , capitalizing a lease . And , um , there was no time . So I had to go with the , my instinct and , you know , capitalize it as an asset and , um , reconfigure the financial statements that way . And once I did that , it looked like they met the loan covenants . So I , um , went forward with it .","Okay . The high stressful situation was once again with a client and we were doing an audit . And with an audit , it can be very invasive and feel that we're asking , you know , lots of questions and almost overwhelming the client . Um , eh , I could pretty much say the client freaked out on me , did not want to reveal certain information . So I had to do like a timeout and just , um , explain to him that this was normal . And , you know , we're not trying to do this to being usee that there's a purpose . And then I pulled out , uh , like what the bank required for their financial statements and , you know , I went from point to point to show him why we're asking these things . So it made a little more sense . Um , he was still a little bit crazy and it was still stressful situation , but it enabled us to get the information that we needed to finish the job .","Okay . Uh , there was a time when I couldn't keep up a commitment that I made . The commitment that I made was to a subordinate . I had told her that after I came back from a client that I would spend some time with her to help her understand a few concepts and um , go over some things with her . And she was , you know , pretty anxious to get this done . I assured her I'll , I'll be here three o'clock , you know , no problem . It won't take you that long at the other client . Well , unfortunately I ran into some issues at the other client and I couldn't meet the three o'clock deadline , nor could I even contact her . Um , so , uh , the next time I saw her , she was pretty upset with me and I had to explain the situation and I said , you know , this was a pain client .

105,Pf27xzb-fk3vsk,"About four years ago , we switched managers , actually my team got reorganized under a different department and the department that we switched to was a very , very structured mode way of doing things . Um , which was , uh , we were used to certainly a structured way , but this was really a toxic , backstabbing cover your own tail environment . Um , none of us were used to that . Um , so it was a big change for me . So what I did was I just continued to do my work the way I had always done , knowing that I was always the top performer on my team , uh , that I was always the go to guy with each manager we've ever had . And that if I just did my job the way it's supposed to be done to doing the things I was doing , that everything would work out fine . So that's what I did . I just did my job and tried to tune out all of the other noise that came with the new environment , new rules , and just did the , did my job the best that I could , and it all did work out in the end .","Early in my career with my current company , I was in basically what was a collections department . We worked with past due credit cards that were anywhere from 30 days to six months past due . Um , the six months past due was called charge off because if we didn't collect , um , money that was owed that month , and by law , we had to sell it to a collection agency and write off the debt , uh , take a loss on the debt . Uh , so at the beginning of each month , we had a book of business . Our teams were divided up into three to four people per team , and you three or four had one book of business to call for that entire month with a total dollar amount that , that book of business owed to the bank . So what I would do was I would try to hit some of the highest ones first and see what we could accomplish , what I could accomplish . Um , we each did our own thing , um , all working on the same book of business . Uh , so I would try to hit some of the harder ones first that were the most past due . Uh , that had been the hardest to get ahold of , hardest to work with , things like that . At the same time , I would also do some from the low end that were on the easier side and some from the middle that could have gone either way that way I was hitting some of each of the categories , giving myself a very good chance at success . So that's how I attack things . Um , and I was always the person on the team that ended up collecting the most , uh , for any given months . Um , that was anywhere from when I worked in 30 days past due all the way up to six months . Um , I was seen as the guy that if you put me on a team , I was going to have that book of business hit , goal and exceed . Um , so going through those things step by step , working the high , the middle of the low all at the same time . So I was encompassing our entire book of business and covering the widest range of , uh , clients that I could potentially touch .","At one point in my career , uh , with my current employer , I was , um , it wasn't really a promotion , uh , but it was added responsibility . It was sort of a promotion , but without a pay raise essentially , um , an opportunity to show what I could do . Um , so I was basically put in charge of a group of people that were working with , uh , small businesses who were past due on their credit cards . And we had a goal to hit for each month . Um , so one , one month in particular , we came down to the final day and we still , my team still had a good bit , uh , to the day , uh , to , uh , at the beginning of the day to go to hit goal . Um , so I was getting information from my direct supervisor , from my supervisor , supervisor , from my fellow managers on , uh , what we needed to do , what was going to work , what wasn't going to work , um , to get to this goal , what's worked for them , things like that . So ultimately what I did was I just relied on my training , what had worked for me in the past . Um , so I put those things into play , things that my team wasn't used to doing , like at the cutter . So it's quite a while ago . Um , um , before , uh , email was the popular , uh , mode , uh , the most efficient mode of communication . Um , I authorized my team to start sending faxes to people's places of employment , um , to get their attention , to get in touch with them , which is something that had always worked for me , uh , personally when I was doing the job that the people that I was managing were doing . Uh , so we did that . It was kind of a spur of the moment thing . We hadn't tried it before in the month and then ended up working on some of the , uh , higher dollar accounts and we did end up hitting goal for that month .","About five years ago . Um , I had switched managers , my team had switched managers and the manager that I was assigned to , uh , was somebody that was extremely , extremely difficult to work with . She did not have a good reputation as a manager . She was a micromanager and scream micromanager , um , and just very hard personality wise to get along with . Nobody on our team liked her , respected her where I wanted to work for . So I had to go to a case that we had , uh , where I was working with outside counsel and outside counsel had advised me to do one thing , which I had been advised by outside counsel numerous other times in the same situation to go ahead and do on behalf of our employer . And when my new manager found out about it , she accused me of going rogue essentially and signing off on something that I didn't have authority to sign off on . I informed her that all I was doing was following the direction of outside counsel who represents our business . Uh , so eventually it got to the point where she was going behind my back to my teammates and to other people , um , and basically trying to gather information to get me fired . So I was to the point where I was either going to quit or I was going to fight for my job , um , and go down and swing . So that's what I did . I bypass her manager , um , who was as untrustworthy as she was and I went two levels ahead . Um , of bosses . I went to my bosses , bosses boss , um , and I just laid it out on the line for when I talked to her . I said , you know , I've always heard what you say in our meetings , in our all hands calls where you say you have an open door policy that if anyone ever needs to say anything to you that we have the floor . So I said , I'm taking a big chance and doing this because this could be my career . And I just laid out everything for her . And what happened was she did believe what I was telling her and she pretty much put my manager in her place . And from that point on , the situation was dropped . My manager created me completely differently and things worked out . She realized that I was a good worker , I was responsible , I was honest , and we got along professionally from that point forward .","I used to work in a line of business within my company where , um , it was required that you , uh , work two Saturdays of overtime per month . Um , and that was a shorter day . It was only four hours . Um , but it was overtime so we were paid time and a half . Um , but it was required that you come in , uh , two out of the four weekends of the month . So on one of the particular weekends that was mine to go in and work , uh , for those four hours . Um , I already had , uh , committed to going to a baseball game with some friends of mine during , it was a day game for our local protein . Um , and we had already had these tickets , um , uh , probably a couple of months prior and then I ended up having to do this overtime . Um , so unfortunately I had to give up the baseball tickets . Um , you know , I didn't want to , I love baseball , but I had to explain to my friends that this was my job . I have to do what I have to do because I want to keep my job and I want to do well on my job . So that's what I did . I ended up not going to the baseball game , kept my commitment of doing the overtime and had a successful month that month of work .",1.666666667,3,2.666666667,2.333333333,3
106,Pnwamws-cpypit,"Okay . Well , uh , so I was working on this project for , um , for a third party vendor . Uh , I was on that project as a consultant and that time I was having difficulties on gathering requirements and , uh , recommends attending every now and then . So what I did to , uh , to address the issue is basically I , um , I say to the respective stakeholders and then we kind of come up with , they came up with a solution that , uh , we will follow these , these steps . Uh , when there is any comments comes in and it needs to go through these , these painting processes , we will not push these changes , uh , as we move along in the current , uh , current product itself , maybe , um , as an enhancement , we will be taking those additional requirements . So , uh , at the end of that project , it helped me like , you know , uh , to streamline all the , all the product and also like , uh , delivered the quality product within , within the timeline . Thank you .","Okay . I , I was working on a project or with very tight deadlines with , uh , uh , with Mary , um , huge requirements , uh , from the client . So because of the of the complexity of the project itself and a requirement was not , uh , defined it the very first , it was very hard to achieve within the deadline that we got from the client . So for that , what I had to do is basically , uh , I had to prioritize all the stories that we'll go through , go in , in the past release , and then , uh , work on those items first rather than , um , then taking all the old items , um , and then just , uh , finished nothing within the timeline . So by doing that , uh , as able to deliver the project within the timeline and the quality of the product was also good in terms of , because we had an uptime to fixing all the marks and everything . Right . Uh , thank you .","Okay . So I also working on this project , her , I had to define the product dimension , uh , pretty quickly for , uh , uh , for the other users to consume . Uh , so for that I had to reach out to businesses and , uh , how , what are the products they're calling it ? And , um , Oh , what are the ideas and what are the parameters ? Uh , but that time I , as I was working with other stakeholders , I was getting conflicting information , uh , because they're saying this is the baseline that we need to approach . Other , other team are saying , no , no , this is the one that we need to follow . So due to that issue , what happened was like , uh , I was not able to come to any concrete decision which is needed for the next level of the product itself . Uh , so , uh , for these , what I did was basically I , um , brought everybody in a single , uh , single room . I'm in , in a single meeting and then we discussed out all our differences . Uh , in that meeting itself , uh , it helped me like , you know , to achieve the goal pretty quickly other than , uh , lots of emails to send four forms . Right ? So , uh , by that way , it was , uh , it was pretty quick . And also , um , we've got the quality , uh , quality data at the end of that session . Thank you .","Okay . So I listed one situation I had to face like , um , last year when I had to complete my , um , thesis for my masters as well as I have , I have a lot of , uh , issues , uh , from my work as well . Uh , so within a very tight deadline I had to finish the project or at the same time I had to use mum . I had to do all my , uh , works , uh , for my office as well . Uh , it was pretty challenging in the , in the sense that , um , uh , I didn't have any sort of idea of the project itself all together and I had to start from the scratch and then , uh , deliver , uh , and present it to a larger group . Uh , so , uh , the , what I did to overcome that , um , uh , that , uh , time was basically what I did was like I , um , took extra pressures . I took , um , I want to open the weekends . I worked at nights and made sure that , um , all the requirements that are meant for the project and also , um , at my office work are delivered within the timeline . Um , I would say the hard work and also like , um , the support , uh , made me , uh , overcome that , uh , hard time that time . Thank you .","Okay . So I was working on this project where I was working with the other , um , uh , department managers , uh , to , um , upgrade certain softwares . I do do other priorities . I could not , um , I could not finish those within the timeline . And , uh , beforehand , before that , I already know that , uh , before that time I , right time arrived . I only knew that I wouldn't be able to finish those within the timeline . What I did in on , in that case , I was like keeping all the stakeholders in loop . Uh , so that , uh , rather than like last minute surprises , I wanted to let them know that this is the status and I need some additional time . Uh , I kind of explained all the steps that I'll be taking it to make sure that it , uh , I'll finish this within the new deadline that I'm asking for . So that way , um , everybody was , um , everybody was on the same page after I want them through my , um , plan , uh , around that . Uh , and after the , after finishing that project , uh , within the new deadline , uh , the managers are pretty happy and they kind of recommended me for a promotion . So it was , um , it was a success , I would say at that time . Thank you .",3,2.5,2.666666667,3,3
107,Pdssmeh-h27hnv,"Hello . Um , in response to a , um , the change in our complex environmental work , I worked on a weapon system , um , that we were a nascent technology and we had matured to the point where we were going into production and I was the scheduler for the task . I dealt with all forms of schedule and of course then the timeline and I interacted with the logistics section about an engineering for procurement , um , where we were on resource utilization , our biggest resource with people . Um , and so how we were assigning engineers essentially to handle complex task relating to the testing , evaluation of the system and then resource loading schedules for budget . And I did such a good job that and kept abreast and tracked all these things that they merged project offices between a missile we were replacing and the missile system we we're currently on . So they combined these two offices and they didn't just hire somebody to or keep a person that had worked on the older missile system . They had me take over both missile systems . And so now I'm dealing with all aspects of program management across two systems and that there's all the requisite problems of dealing with staffing and all that . Um , because the older missile system was still developing , new software was being written , hardware was being updated , and your increments were being planned prior to the longterm adoption of the new system . So I took this all in stride . Um , my boss was really proud of me and I was well compensated and well rewarded for taking on the additional efforts and , um , and eventually led to a promotion and , uh , changing positions , uh , due to my efforts .","So with a missile system I've worked on , we had to get it ready for a milestone activity . Had to go before a lot of really important people and get their approval . And to do that we had to meet a lot of legal and organizational hurdles . Um , to get there . There's a lot of work that had to be compressed . And as the scheduler I had to present solutions to management on how to do that . They gave me a series of constraints , um , namely that things had fallen behind schedule and they asked how do we can't , or one can we get on schedule to which I said the answer with the current resources is no and to , okay , how do we get on schedule ? And ultimately I used my scheduling skills , um , to analyze the timeline , look at staffing and figure out where we could plus up people , where we could bring in matrix and other engineers or other logistics people into the organization or do new hires and get them prickly trained to basically be human computers and handle more data . Uh , we were not kept by computing power . We were kept by , uh , our alternate resource , which was people . So we actually brought in more people . We spent a good deal of money , but we reached our organizational objective , got all the approvals and move to the next milestone . Uh , we were well re rewarded a row , well-regarded , and it was a team effort and I was really proud to have been part of that team .","So , uh , I was in a scheduling position , my first scheduling position , and my program manager came to me and said , our customer is asking for us to do a really complex task in a really short amount of time . That's the bad news . The good news is , is provides an opportunity to get additional option years funded on our contract and bring in more people , uh , spend more money , uh , earn more for our company , um , while ultimately giving the customer what they requested . So I was asked to do the what if scenario , uh , the analysis and scenarios and my boss , he had this quickly because we needed to spend the money quickly due to the customer requirement , um , which was related to security situation in a Guinness DeAnn . Um , so lives are on the line . So I quickly looked through the requirements . Um , and then I figured out staffing solutions , I looked at the list of requirements and figuring out , okay , here's how your engineers and logisticians here is how many people we need to forward deploy to Afghanistan to support the mission . And ultimately , here's what it's going to cost . Now the first cost assessment isn't necessarily the best because it was a little high . It was more than we can , the customer's willing to spend . So we had sort of recalculate , okay , let's , let's look at our numbers . Let's reprioritize where we are in the support and engineering process to best accomplish the mission with the available dollars . Um , and then strive towards the option . The end result was we produced a great plan . Um , it was approved by the customer . The project got additional funding , uh , went on for about two more years , longer than originally anticipated and met its mission goals of protecting soldiers and service men , uh , downrange . And it was really honored to be a part of this .","So a very high pressure situation was when I was in Iraq . And so during the day our unit would play the logistics missions and night carry those out . I was the person in charge of carrying out those missions . I had ultimate authority on whether things happened or didn't . And I was young and there were about 1100 people in this unit , in this battalion . It was the largest unit of its type in theater , possibly ever , um , in theater . And a lot of things went right . A lot of things went wrong , but really a lot of things required a decision based on what had happened or what could happen . And so one of the things is putting lives on the line while balancing the priority of what needs to get through all the logistics convoy . So we had a situation where we need to get water , munitions and other supplies to another pace and due to various delays due to weather , um , we had a convoy that couldn't get out . It was carrying much needed supplies . And so we only operated at night and there were special exceptions to go into the day because it was a higher risk . Um , we could see at night , but the bad guys could see us during the day and plot against us . So ultimately I had to make a decision for a certain convoy , whether to send them or not . I had to take you to Teligent analysis . I had to consider who was on the convoy , which teams and their level of experience and the route and all of my , I made a decision and I sent them and they got hit with an IED . Um , nobody died . Uh , their truck was severely damaged . It was written off and ultimately the supplies got there . Nobody got hurt . Some people rattled and that was an extremely high pressure situation . But the mission dictated it . You always put people in , but sometimes the mission requires it and making those decisions is something you have to deal with . Whether it was successful or there were issues along the way . I was ultimately very justly rewarded and praise for my efforts because I allowed a base to continue to operate at full functionality .","Um , so time I had difficult to keep a commitment isn't my most recent position . I work on schedules . Um , the spanning agency , uh , involve a lot of moving pieces , a lot of people , um , a lot of sources and information ultimately produce very attractive and very functional and usable products . I'm also assigned to integrate big data solutions and visualization into the agency specific specifically as early as the schedule and both of them are high priority and are asked for by me then When dealing with multiples forces . Ultimately I have to go to management ask , okay , I have a limited , limited level of , I have a , I'm at a hundred percent level of effort . One , may I push something to the side , here's what I recommend . Do I have your approval ? And ultimately I got my approval . I was able to work on the schedules , um , deal with all the people that influenced the schedules to produce a product while still working on the big data visualization and Jen and ultimately delivering a product successfully for that , getting the software integrated and out to a customer base and getting that customer base to use it . Um , I was rewarded with a bonus , uh , for my efforts in dealing with the data visualization technique , as well as getting accolades for continuing my primary position of supporting scheduled development .",3.333333333,3,3.5,3.666666667,3
108,Pssguz9-2whaiw,"In my years of experience as a project manager , I've had to adapt to many situations somewhere . I have expertise in somewhere . I did not , especially where I wasn't an expert in the area . I had to um , bring in people who knew the area , who I can depend upon and uh , leverage them , uh , to get the project moving . Uh , we have to overcome obstacles . We have , there will come budgets and it was my job as project manager to make sure all those things happen , to keep things moving along . Um , w when I didn't know something , um , it was OK , I knew how to , I knew how to find out and get the right people involved . And that's what being a project manager is all about . Uh , keeping all the plates spinning , keeping all the people moving , keeping them engaged and inspired . Uh , and we're all , you know , like growing the boat together and two to one goal and that's , uh , what my job was . And as you can see on my resume , I have accomplished that many times in several different disciplines and , um , have generally been successful all the times are all the projects I've been on .","The project we were working on was difficult . Implementing a new , uh , uh , collaboration system , um , it was difficult . And to achieve the goal , we broke it up into , uh , small , obtainable pieces , uh , using agile , um , by using agile and breaking the , uh , pieces of the project into sprints for the individual contributors , we were able to , uh , move it forward . And , you know , maybe we had to backtrack a little bit , get different people involved , but as long as the momentum was forward and we were making progress , uh , that was the most important thing . So getting the right people and making forward progress . So that was the right thing to do .","Sometimes you don't have all the information you want at the time . A decision needs to be made . Uh , you do your best to collect the information , get the right people , but in the end , either you're stalled or , or you have to make a decision . Uh , and there were times when I've had the , the side for the project , I made a decision and it might've been the wrong decision , but at least we tried something and if it didn't work , um , we cut our losses quickly , didn't waste too much time , backtrack a little bit and went forward again . Um , but that's the job of a project manager that's take the input and make the best possible decision at the time up from the resources and information you have available . It's most important to keep the project moving . And if you need to try multiple things , as soon as you try them , the sooner you can either succeed or try something else . So the more information the better . And the speed was important too .","In the security nature of my job , uh , often we have incidents , uh , where we have to act as quickly as possible to protect the company's assets and data and the people and employees . Uh , so sometimes we have to , uh , act rapidly . It may not be the right solution , uh , but we try something , we do it in such a way that we , uh , attempt something and leave ourselves , you know , uh , an ability to backtrack and try again if we're , uh , made the wrong decision . Um , and we don't lose any data in the process . So we try something , we always give a self as a way to backtrack . Um , but the , but speed is important and protecting the company is the most important thing in an incidents like this .","As a project manager , you're going to have different commitments to meet and different timelines , and you try your best to meet them all . But that's not always possible . So when that happens , you just have to look at which ones you can meet , which ones you can't . And sometimes you have to notify your stakeholders that you're not going to meet their commitment on time or possibly not at all . Uh , sometimes you try to renegotiate the commitment to something from something that was not obtainable to something that isn't stainable . Maybe it's a a way point , uh , where you can get halfway or three quarters of the way and satisfy somebody and give them a new day to move on from the completion . Um , you do the best you can that he everybody happy and it's not always possible . So you try and keep most people happy in the shortest amount of time .

109,Pa588af-gyrqy6,"Probably the most challenging and complex work environment I've ever encountered would be with the most important job I've ever had , which is the job of being a dad . Um , I have four children and my second oldest child was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder at a young age . Um , and it was fairly apparent from , from a very early age that he was struggling with something that his older sibling and eventually , um , his young , younger siblings were not . And primarily , um , I am the day to day , uh , child care taker , uh , between my wife and I . She works a very demanding , um , white color career job . Um , and before the pandemic she was out of the house , uh , most of the time . Um , I do a little bit of freelance work , um , here and there . Um , but my , my main job , my main career has been as a parent and I had to very quickly become an expert , um , as much as one can on bipolar disorder and , uh , mental health issues for children , which is something I had absolutely no training or background in . But , um , this was the life and welfare of my child that was at stake . And , um , he is very much struggling with it . He probably will for the rest of his life . Um , barring wonderful advancements in mental health , which I hope will come someday , but they're not forthcoming immediately as far as I can tell . So it has certainly been a constant challenge , but I've had no choice but to adapt and learn as best I can and juggle all sorts of competing demands and , um , competing opinions on what is the best course of treatment for him , the best way to help them best medications . There's certainly no consensus in , uh , the mental health care community as I have learned . But , um , Yeah , compared to some other challenges of it , I have had a hit in my life my previous life before I had children . Um , many , uh , close calls I had as a pilot , um , difficult situations I had in the military having to overcome unique and bizarre technical and tactical and situational challenges .","Uh , relating this back tonight , my previous response from the earlier question , um , I think I may have gone on a bit long because my , my recording automatically shut off after a couple of minutes . But , um , I had to set and achieve the goals of informing myself , um , as best I could about how to take care of a child with severe mental health problems . This involved reaching out to our healthcare provider . Um , that was the first step . And learning to navigate the pediatric mental health process and then really , really beginning the never ending process of educating myself , um , about all the literature , all the peer reviewed information that is out there , various support groups , various different theories of treatment , many of which are at odds with each other and navigating how to help my child and how to be an advocate for him . And now , many , many years into this , um , though my child still struggles and I have not accomplished the goal of making him well , whatever that would mean . Um , I have a chief , the goal of at least helping him manage . Um , then of course I should give credit to my wife as well , who has done just as much work to that goal . But , um , it's very challenging . There was no roadmap . Um , it was sink or swim , and it still is , but I am continuing to learn every day . And that's where it all starts with , with learning and always , always being willing to set aside whatever preconceived ideas I may have and being willing to accept new information and to implement it in a useful and helpful way .","So I guess with this question , I should switch gears a bit . Um , this , my response does not have to do with , uh , my previous responses with my child and his mental health issues . Um , the first thing that comes to mind as far as the situation where I needed to make an important decision quickly , um , would be , Oh , about 30 years ago as a , as a very young buck Sergeant and the us air force , I was , um , tasked with me and a small group of three or four people in my squad . Um , we needed to erect a 40 foot tall aerial antenna , high-frequency radio antenna . Um , it happened to be in the middle of the desert in a flat area with little other terrain , um , at night in the middle of a lightning storm . And , um , as almost anyone above the age of 10 years old knows you , it's not a good idea to be playing with very long , tall pieces of metal , um , exposed out in the open , in the middle of a lightning storm . And we were aware of this and , um , our superiors in the tactical space , uh , we received some conflicting , um , directives , one of which was this is , this is not absolutely mission critical . Uh , use your own judgment if you feel it's not safe , you don't need to do this . We have redundant systems that can help . Um , but we were also strongly , um , strongly urge that anything we could do to help get it up would be , um , much appreciated and would really help the mission go forward . So I decided that we should go ahead and do it , but I would not , I would not order anyone to do it . Um , anyone who did not feel okay doing it was fine . I could probably handle it with one other person and I wanted to volunteer , but I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything . I wouldn't do myself . And there were measures we could take to make it as safe as we reasonably could . Um , everyone volunteered to do it and we ended up getting the antenna set up and working and actually myself and the others were , um , awarded a meritorious service medal . Um , a little bit later for our actions for getting the antenna up and working in the middle of a lightening storm , which is , uh , a fun story . Um , I'm not sure , um , when I tell that story to my children , if it's a cautionary tale or exactly what the moral of that story is , but , uh , that would be how I would have .","Uh , high pressure , stressful situation . Sure . Uh , about 20 years ago I was a fairly inexperienced helicopter pilot , um , completing some cross country flight training and I was approaching downtown Dallas , Texas from the East and it was about 2000 feet above ground and I experienced a flight control malfunction . Um , try to be as nontechnical as I can . I guess the , uh , there's several flight controls in a helicopter that kind of look like the controls on an airplane , but they function quite a bit differently . And my collective control , which controls the angle of pitch , the main rotor blade , the big propeller on top , which , which , uh , is not a propeller . But anyway , um , one of its main functions is it lets you go up or down . And it became , for lack of a better word , it became stuck . It would not go up or down and I could not change my altitude . Um , and there's a number of procedures , um , that I'd been trained on , uh , for various inflight emergencies . However , this particular one was not something I had received a lot of training on . It's actually a very uncommon problem . Um , so I had to first of all not panic , um , and think through the situation , but not take my time , not spend too much time thinking through it . Um , needless to say , I did survive obviously . Um , I did manage to land the helicopter , um , safely in one piece and I did actually kiss the ground once I got out . Um , but yes , that , that situation more than anything taught me that , um , um , while it was the , it was the first time , I think I realized in the moment that it was happening . Um , Oh my God , my life is actually literally in my hands here . Um , what , what I do with my hands as far as controlling this machine will determine , um , whether I safely land this aircraft . And , um , I didn't panic it , at least not until I was on the ground and had , uh , some time to think about just exactly what had happened . But , um , yes , I was able to deal with , um , a very stressful , uh , very high pressure situation , think it through and , um , come to a successful outcome .","Well , this is honestly a difficult one to answer . I'm not because I can't think of any , any response , but because there's really too many , um , Instances that I can think of where something like this has happened , um , as a parents of four children who takes care of them pretty much by myself every day . Um , well juggling various other work commitments , um , and school commitments for my children , um , healthcare requirements for my son . Um , I always , um , excuse me , I always seem to be burning my candle at both ends to some extent and juggling commitments and priorities . So rather than give one specific example , um , I would only answer that this question that I'm being asked , how I , um , find difficulty keeping commitments and how I , how I deal with those situations would be that , um , I , I somehow manage by , by the grace of God and good luck . I managed to get the important stuff done . However , however it needs to be done , you know , within reason and within the bounds of the law . I make it work . I make stuff work .",3.25,3.25,3.666666667,3.666666667,1.666666667
110,Pt4wa4z-9g89c2,"Recently , we're working on a front end application for customer service representatives in order to allow them to see the data of any clients who might be contacting them as part of an escalation process for our client . It was complicated because what exactly the customer service representatives were going to see wasn't decided on by the business unit and the business unit would change their mind about what data points they thought would be relevant for the escalations . It took us a few tries to come up with a layout for all the data and also what data points they were looking for that they thought would meet the requirements of the most likely escalations that they would see , and we had to do a lot of additional requirement gathering sessions as well as be flexible and agile in terms of pivoting for the new requirements .","The new customer service representative interface needed to be completed in the space of two months . This was a difficult situation because that's a very tight timeline that we needed to work between and with the changing requirements , we were under a bit of a time crunch . Um , the , the main action that we took was we created a backlog that had prioritized items to create a minimum viable product that the clients would be able to give us iterative feedback on and worked really diligently to ensure that we were able to optimize the distribution of tasks among our team so that no one was doing rework and that everyone was able to contribute and help out in areas , even if they weren't necessarily their original focus area . By pulling together as a team , we were able to meet the aggressive timeline , but it did take a lot of work and collaboration .","When we were developing the UI for our customer service representative escalations tool , we were faced with conflicting information around what the historic data for our client should look like . Different groups thought different pieces of information were going to be of the highest priority , and we needed to make a decision about what the layout was going to be so that we would be able to start prototyping it and giving it to our customer service representatives to receive their feedback on the usability . Um , eventually we , we looked at all of the information we were given and synthesize it to see which areas conflicted the least , created a prototype and then started doing our testing on it regardless , we needed to move forward because we were under time pressure and it ended up being okay because the feedback that we got was on the whole positive .","As it got down to the end of our time building the UI for the customer service representative tool for the escalations we were given . We had a large number of defects that were outstanding in terms of response time and also throwing errors that we were unable to identify . The root cause of it was stressful because the executives were really breathing down our necks in order to try and make us meet the timelines . And what we ended up having to do was pull a lot of late nights to do some steps , step-by-step walkthroughs of the code to see where we were failing and what the possible root causes would be . And then once we had identified the root causes , we had to all come together to come up with solutions for different ways to do the requests and responses so that we wouldn't have this type of issue as well as restructure one of the databases so that we didn't , we no longer had to my issue there as well . Um , the approach was essentially to work collectively as a team through our burn down chart and move forward with testing as quickly as possible .","When we kicked off our project , we made a commitment to ensure that no one was going to have to work overtime into the evenings . We were unable to have maintain that commitment as it got closer to the crunch time , because there simply were not enough hours in a day . And this was a vendor , or this was a client who we couldn't afford to lose . So we had to ask our employees to pull a few late nights with us . Um , we minimize it as much as possible by providing food and accommodation for people who had to do longer commutes so that we would all be able to be onsite and work as a team to get through it . Um , and we've , we've done our retrospectives in order to ensure that doesn't happen again . We understand that it was a onetime ask for our team and are grateful for the sacrifice that they made .",3,2,3,3,3
111,Piqwba8-hi4r3x,"In my previous role , I was in charge of , um , schedule procurement , um , in charge of training , um , employees as well as making sure that , um , the employees are properly shadowed and properly trained in , um , within the actual job environment . So I , we had recently hired a new employee who , um , actually experienced some hearing impairment . Um , now they weren't entirely deaf . They did have some hearing . However , they did have some difficulties . Um , reading lips . Now this was during coven . And so as you can imagine , the implementation of masks made this really difficult in terms of training and making sure that the client or the employee rather could be heard and understood and also that they could hear and understand us . So what we did to adapt was , although we were supposed to be wearing masks , um , what we did was we implemented a new system for anyone who is training this employee where they were allowed to wear either face masks or a face shield rather , or they were able to wear a face mask that allowed , um , the vision of their lips . So that way the employee was able to somewhat lip read . Um , now , obviously those face masks as well as the face shields tend to get quite foggy . So what we also implemented was , um , the employee , because they did have some hearing . Um , they actually had this special device where they had a , um , like a , a hearing aid almost , but they had also a little microphone . And so whoever had the microphone , they were able to hear . So we implemented while keeping the employees , you know , privacy and everything , um , at the utmost importance . We implemented the use of this microphone . So that way , not only could our employee see what was going on , you know , with people's face . Um , if they couldn't , for whatever reason , if it was foggy or anything , then they also had the use of this microphone to be able to hear and be properly trained .","One of the projects that I worked on was implementing a brand new online training for employees at a hospital . Um , this training basically entailed creating videos , um , for them to use for their training as well as basically an online application . Um , so to develop this application we basically hired a graduate or um , college students rather , sorry . Um , and we had these college students beginning to create the application . Now one of the reason why this goal was difficult to achieve was because , um , halfway through the development of the project and the application , um , the project manager who was in charge of the application itself . Um , because I , I have no coding experience , um , actually I had to go on maternity leave . So there was no replacement in place . So what we ended up doing , knowing that myself as a project manager didn't have the experience necessary to , you know , guide and supervise these students in creating an application . What we ended up doing was we ended up hiring , um , externally . So we looked at other professors within the college who did have coding experience , who also had experience in teaching , which was a particular importance given that these were still college students . Um , although they were , you know , excellent , very knowledgeable . They also still need a lot of support . So when we were looking externally , we looked for specifically , um , college and university professors of coding . So that , that way , not only would they be able to properly , uh , you know , supervise the project , but also be able to guide and train these , um , students in their coding as they went on . So ultimately , um , the , the project was successful . Um , we finished on time and , um , the students were trained properly as well .","So in one hospital setting that I've worked in as a project manager , um , we had hired a new employee and I received word from some of the doctors . I received some complaints , number one , about the efficiency of said employee , um , that they were very slow , um , and not very attentive to detail . Um , and then on the other side I also heard from several of the other employees , so this employees peers that the employee was dressed unprofessionally wearing sweat pants to work . Um , and that , um , you know , was ultimately also putting himself in danger and putting others in danger as , um , because this was a hospital setting . He was talking to patients and actually giving them medical advice , um , without being a medical professional . So what we ended up having to do is as soon as we heard that , um , we scheduled a meeting with him , um , and I met with him and just discussed the concerns , um , brought up the , uh , complaints that were laid against him as well as the concerns laid against him , um , and gave him his chance to tell his side of the story . Um , ultimately he did end up admitting to doing all of said , um , complaints . So , um , he said that , you know , he did understand , um , medicine and believed that he was , um , in the right to be able to suggest holistic medicine to sick individuals . Um , given that this was a safety matter in the sense that he was giving medical advice where he is certainly not , um , it would , it's not appropriate to do so . Um , we had a very brief discussion about the implications of this and one the employee did not understand , um , in the sense that he was very adamant that it was within his right to give holistic medicine advice to sick people in a hospital . Um , we made the very quick decision , um , that he would unfortunately have to be like , Oh , he was still within his probationary period . Um , and so we went through the steps , um , to let , to fire him effectively in terminate his employment . Um , unfortunately it was , you know , it was a situation where we weren't able to , um , retrain or , um , push him forward since it was a safety matter .","Most of my work is in the emergency room at the hospital . And so obviously I'm , I'm , I'm privy to a lot of really vulnerable moments that patients encounter , um , as well , you know , often very high stress situations . So , um , we had a client or rather a patient come in who , um , was unfortunately feeling very suicidal and who attempted to kill himself in the middle of the , um , emergency room . So as somebody who is not a medical professional , I'm not a doctor . Um , however I was currently , you know , it was middle of the night , there weren't many nurses , there weren't many doctors . Um , I was more or less alone . So what I did was I followed a hospital protocol . So I , um , called a code white , which is essentially an aggressive patient . Um , he didn't meet criteria for any of the other hospital codes . So this one I knew would ultimately have security come to help me , um , in restraining him and keeping him safe from himself . Um , and while as well as have doctors come running , um , who can help them in medically . Um , so after I called the code white , I maintained my distance to keep myself safe . Um , but I also tried to talk to him . Um , Justin killed until security came , um , to try and keep him calm and to also try and prevent him from doing any further damage from himself . Um , ultimately security and the doctors did come very quickly and they were able to restrain him . They were able to sedate him , and he was able to get these psychological help that he needed .","So in this role that I worked in , I was not only working as the project manager for a team of approximately 30 employees , but I was also actively working in the hospitals as well . Um , basically doing , um , you know , lower level things , less managerial things at the same time . Um , so often what would happen is I would have my project manager role , um , tasks and priorities , including , you know , training , hiring , scheduling , that sort of thing as well as , um , basically this , this lower level position . Um , so often I would schedule myself in for these lower level position shifts just so that I could help out the team . Um , and there was a time when I had scheduled myself for one of these shifts and , um , ultimately ended up having a couple of crises come up at work regarding , um , hiring and training . Just some , um , difficulties regarding , um , one employee was , was just having trouble and needed additional support . So , given that my priority ultimately is as project manager to make sure that my employees are properly trained , they're safe at work and to make sure that they are , um , doing their duties as need be . What I ultimately did was I number one , um , created myself a priority list in terms of okay , what needs to be done , what do I need to achieve , um , and what needs to be done in order for me to both , you know , accomplish my , um , project manager role as well as accomplish my lower level role . So ultimately I made the priority list with a time limit on each one of how long I had to complete each task before . Um , I would basically have to give up the shift . So ultimately what ended up happening is the training and implementation of this employee that needed help did take much longer than anticipated . And so I looked around , I made sure , um , to get my shift covered cause I didn't want to , you know , leave my other employees hanging . Um , and I made it very clear as to why I needed the shift covered . Um , and explained to them , basically I took full responsibility . That was my fault and I , I did overwork myself and I did , um , make an error in judgment in that sense that I did not , um , anticipate basically additional training needs . And for that I apologize to the employees . Um , and thankfully one of them did step up and agree to take my shift for me . Um , so the team was still strong and the team was still covered . Um , and ultimately after that , what I did was knowing that this did come up as a problem , I now , when I scheduled myself , I would implement extra time or anticipate extra time for any extraneous situations that may occur .",3.666666667,3,3.5,3.333333333,3.333333333
112,P3dmsvc-a448tz,"A time when I needed to adapt to , um , changing in a changing environment at work was when we had to start going , um , teaching virtually instead of teaching in the classroom . We went from seeing the kids every day to having to work online , deciding whether we were meeting with them every day , contacting through email , setting up Google classrooms , um , which a lot of us were unfamiliar with . Um , but the leadership above us was very direct in what they wanted . And everybody , for the most part , had no problem in adapting in the best way possible given the circumstances . Um , many of the students , you know , had have more difficult time than the teachers , I would say , but teachers did adapt accordingly .","A situation where I needed to set goals for myself and , um , achieve them in a more difficult situation where I was when I was in grad school , I was also working at a full time job and trying to complete my masters , um , in the evenings and on the weekends .

Um , but I was able to do this by making sure I was extremely organized . I had a lot of lists . Um , I had a calendar where I had everything laid out . I knew what was due , when , whether it was for work or for school , um , and I was able to get everything done that I needed to in a timely manner by staying organized .","A situation where I needed to make a decision quickly and I was faced with information from multiple sources was when I was deciding whether I was going to get vaccinated or not . Um , there was a lot of information coming from both sides saying that people should get vaccinated , saying that people should not be getting vaccinated . And I had a short window of time to , you know , do my research and decide . Um , so I did the best that I could to research the best educational and statistical resources that I could , and in the end made the decision that I felt was best given a multitude of different factors . I kind of weighed my options and then made my decision based on all of that .","I would say a time when I had to cope with a high pressure or stressful situation was when I was trying to complete school and working a full time job . Um , I had a lot of responsibilities for both school and for my job . There was a lot of group projects . Um , so I definitely was , you know , crunched for time and had a lot on my plate . Um , like I had said previously , I just tried to stay as organized as possible . I kept in touch with my coworkers to make sure I was staying on task . I kept in touch with my classmates to make sure I was staying on task and I just did the best that I could to make sure I got everything that I was responsible for completing done in the amount of time that I was supposed to get it done in . Um , overall I was successful . I was able to complete my job and I was able to finish grad school .","Um , a time that I had a difficult time keeping a commitment that I had made , um , at work due to other priorities that had come up would probably be when I had committed to attending a play after school . But I also did not realize I had some other school related responsibilities that needed to be completed . Um , at the same time , I felt bad about not being able to go to the play . So I moved some things around in my schedule and although I was not able to attend on the opening night , I was able to attend on a different night . Um , so in the end it all worked out well . Nobody's feelings were hurt . I just needed to shift some things around .",3,2,1.666666667,2.666666667,2.333333333

114,Pqczh9z-f6mxp5,"Uh , so at times I had to adapt to a changing or complex environment at work . Um , well my work right now is actually very , uh , very changing and very dynamic and extremely complex . Um , one particular system that we deal with is , uh , called the company news environment . This company news environment is critical for our airport out . It involves , uh , multiple different vendors as well as multiple different user parties . Uh , airlines for example , different airlines will use the system and different vendors at the airlines or purchase are on top of the system . And then we have a separate vendor that runs or at least Owens and builds up this particular system . So we have three sets of parties that we have to interact with just to make sure the system operates in a very , uh , smooth fashion . Um , on top of that we have all of also the , all the it staff and departments , networking , uh , the server team , et cetera , that also have to be party to this system to keep it operational . It is highly dynamic and changes on a constant basis as not only does the vendor provide updates to the system , the airlines themselves , the systems that they work with that are layered on top of the system also are updated . So on a constant basis , we get messages from the airlines or from the vendor to perform updates to specific airlines that have software on there that they need update it . What I've done in that role is I help form multiple peripheral processes that not only ensure that these updates are done in a fashion that allows the system to continue operating , uh , seamlessly without , without downtime , but also a , a record system for those updates . Um , what we've found is that some of those updates don't always work and we've , uh , had , uh , in the past multiple issues with those . So what we'll do is we will , uh , have , uh , in parallel the update in the old system running at the same time , uh , and allow for the airline to approve those updates prior to , uh , making them kind of a fully live environment .","Hmm . Um , so describe a time , uh , you set goals for projects that were hard to achieve . Um , well , uh , going back to common use , uh , from the previous , uh , example , the coming as a environment we had was being upgraded , outgoing to a , um , we call it an upgrade . However , it was a brand new or system essentially , um , even though it was from the same vendor . So to complete that upgrade , uh , we had to make sure that every airline that we currently had running on that system was on board with the upgrade as well as getting all of their software onto the new platform . Because of the upgrade . Some of the software packages that the airlines had were not compatible . So the goal was to get every airline onto the new platform in one way , shape , or form . Uh , the steps that we took to take it to make sure that this happened , uh , were multiple . Uh , first I had to make sure that , uh , the vendor was aware of every single airline and every single application that that airline had on , on their platform . Secondly , they had to be certified . We can make sure that the vendor , uh , quote unquote certified each of those applications , um , as a vendor specific process to make sure that the ear of the vendor approves those applications on their platform . And third , we had to make sure that both the vendor and the airline , uh , and the airlines application vendor all were , uh , uh , agreeing that the application was working as expected and intended , uh , and was operationally useful for that airline . Uh , we had a series of , uh , acceptance tasks , um , our rather large lists that we would go through with the vendor and the airline for those every single piece of software . And we checked off and made sure that every one of those tasks operationally and technically were completed successfully . Once the airline tested out the new product or the new , uh , software on the new platform , they checked off that they accepted it and it was working with all of the services that they required , um , that those steps there did actually contribute to the full success of the project . At the end of the day , it was actually a , it took a long time about longterm than was expected , but we achieved the results we were looking for , and it was , I was actually very , very pleased with those results .","So a situation where I needed to make an important decision quickly , but we're faced with conflicting information . While as a systems analyst , I routinely run into conflicting information sometimes . Um , and at times am half , I do have to make decisions quickly . So , uh , last week actually we had a situation or we getting an incident , um , our frontline services we call them , uh , is that kind of our , uh , onsite support team . They started getting reports that , or a report that one of the airlines was unable to log in and use their , uh , their station , uh , for common use . So I was working in remote , so we had to log in and find out , uh , what was going on . I logged into the station and it showed information that I had absolutely not seen before and basically just showed , um , almost like no information , however , it was still connected to the network . So that was very confusing . It should not , if it was not showing any know , any information , it shouldn't be connected to the network . As far as I was aware , we went to , uh , expand , uh , determined the full scope and we found that other stations , that terminal or hit one location , uh , where this software resides , uh , was also having the same problem , but it , we weren't getting any other reports of any problems . So we started checking in multiple different sources and some stations on in other locations were working , which was quite confusing . Um , I went into the server and the server was not showing any particular issues , however it was looking at Kevin running kind of slow , it seemed , so it seemed like it was captured , but it wasn't . Um , I had to make a decision because the airline needed to use the system right away if they , if it doesn't work right right away , they basically they can't board flights and they lose money . Um , I made the decision to restart the server , um , knowing that it would kick anyone that was on their off , so potentially affect other airlines . I'm , uh , quite away , um , with the hope that it would fix this problem right now . Uh , fortunately when I restarted it , it came back up . And not only was that airline able to operate , but all the other lines suddenly started working , uh , or continued to work as expected . So it was very , uh , good to see it worked .","A time I had to cope with high pressure or stressful situation at work ? Um , well very recently we came across a situation where our , one of our critical systems , uh , uh , database cluster is what it is started failing on us now . This database cluster . Um , well first of all it shouldn't have as it was . Um , it housed a lot of different databases that are critical to our environment and are critical to the systems that I support personally . Um , one of them being our flight display system . We have , uh , for reference we have over 38 million people that go through our airport every year , which is about 120 , 150,000 people per day running through our airport flight display system is the only system that they have to know where their flight is . So if that goes down , we have 150,000 people that don't know how to get critical to for their flights . The situation was that what has the database was failing here , a risk of losing that flight display database , which shows all the flights . So if that display database people stay on all the flights go black on her , on her screens , the situation was that we had to effectively move that database onto a new cluster that was working . So I had to basically , I had to interact with multiple different vendors just to get the database moved in a timely fashion because we knew that that could fail at any point . So timing was key , um , uh , for , for better or worse , um , obviously panicking or , um , you know , Freddy and Mount this will , wouldn't do anything . So I had to basically be very common direct to each one of our vendors and express to them exactly the situation , how time sensitive the situation was and , uh , work with them continuously , uh , throughout this whole process to make the changes they needed to move the database to the new location . Um , the outcome was we actually got it working at 1130 at night , but it worked . Um , and ironically , uh , not five hours after we were done , the original database did finally die . So we literally dodged the bullet on getting that moved successfully .","Uh , well I had time . I experienced difficult to keep it a commitment . I may , due to other important priorities , um , many times we do find yourself in situations where incidents or critical time sensitive tasks are required of us . Uh , sometimes we have to literally drop everything just to work on those particular tasks or incense . Um , one , uh , commitment that I had made was to kind of help out a project team , um , manager , get a , uh , demonstration set up for the um , or for our , uh , display systems and they needed that done by a certain or the drop dead date . We had to get that done by , I was set to do that work . However , unfortunately , um , my , um , my daughter became sick obviously , and so I couldn't go in physically to get that work done . Um , when I had to do them basically was , um , I had to get ahold of the grandparents , honestly , um , have them come over and , uh , they were able to take care of her for a period of time so that I was able to go into the office , get the work , uh , set up , configured and done before . Um , basically I , uh , praying back home to , uh , again , you know , take care of my daughter . Um , but fortunately , uh , the work was done on time as needed , and our leadership team that came out to view the product or view the demonstration , uh , were happy with their results . So it worked out .",3.333333333,3,3.333333333,3.666666667,3

And I think that that was a time where a really channeled , challenging environment , um , was able to be overcome by strict adherence to the norms that I had set up for our team's schedule .","A time that I set goals for myself that were difficult to , to achieve . Um , and , but that I was able to achieve , uh , was when I was working for a nonprofit organization in Calgary . When I was working for a nonprofit organization in Calgary , my manager came to me and he said that what he wanted to do was for our organization to increase attendance and the commitment level of attendance , um , to our regular meetings by 50% . Um , and the way that we decided to do that was through a community outreach program . And in this community outreach program , we had to reach the members of our local community and both get them excited about what we were doing as a nonprofit organization and help them to become engaged in our community . Uh , this was very difficult to do because the community that we lived in , um , did not have a very good community spirit to be honest . Um , the majority of people were commuters . Um , very few people spent time in the local area or in the local community . And the neighborhood culture was very fragmented . What we ended up doing was a series of , not just one or two , but a regularly scheduled community external event where I organized and planned and executed , uh , activities for the kids and , uh , organize music and food . And , uh , we were able to not only create a community culture , but then we actually did increase act . Um , we actually did increase , uh , uh , attendance to our local community programs by about 47% , which was at a high achieving goal . I think . Something to be very proud of .","When it comes to managing complex situations and people , uh , both flexibility and decisiveness is really important . So a situation in which I had to make a very quick decision and an important decision when receiving multiple information from multiple sources would have been a time earlier this year , uh , when I was helping the athletic director at our school to host a tournament in our facility , uh , I had been left alone as the supervisor , the on-staff supervisor of the entire facility . I was also assistant coaching my own volleyball team . Um , but I was responsible for ensuring that all the games started smoothly and it was eight o'clock in the morning and it's seven 45 . One of the volleyball teams had not yet arrived . One uh , other coach told me she thought they didn't wake up that morning from the hotel . She thinks she thought that they had a , she what she told me where she thought that they had gotten a scheduling error . Someone else told me they thought they were on their way and someone else told me that the rule was if a team did not show up by 15 minutes before the game , they forfeited the game . I needed to make a decision very quickly and unfortunately had not been given contact information from this team . Uh , and what I ended up having to do was locate that team's contact information myself by doing a quick dig through the internet , um , and then by calling them and they didn't pick up the phone . So I had no idea where they were if they were on their way . And as this was the very first game of the morning , if I didn't make the right call and making it in a timely fashion , uh , then what would end up happening is the entire day's tournament would delay and delay and delay . And some of these teams had traveled five hours to be there and delays meant they would have a five hour trip back that would be , um , now coming into midnight , one o'clock in the evening instead of 10 or 11 o'clock at night . So what I ended up doing was making a very quick decision . There was another game that was running parallel at the same time that could play earlier . And so we swapped the teams that were going to play and the team that was delayed that hadn't showed up came about 15 minutes later . They hadn't had a scheduling error . They didn't realize they were supposed to play . But because I quickly got the other two teams on the court , that team that was late was able to play their parallel game a half an hour later and everything was resolved , um , sufficiently . And so that was a time when I had to make a quick decision with conflicting with conflicting information and being able to do that . Um , in this case , save the day .","I have pressure situation that I have encountered and then was able to overcome and cope with was this very semester as a teacher in high school , um , with a social studies 30 dash one course in Alberta . A social studies 30 dash one course is a high level academic course that's intended to prep students for university . Uh , this is my first time teaching the course and I had a dual task . Task number one was to bring students up to the academic standard of the grade 12 high school graduation diploma , which is a standardized test that these students have to take . The reason that this was stressful was because it was my first time teaching the course . And also because these students had been through Covidien for their grade , 10 and 11 years had never actually written a final exam and it had major gaps in their instruction through their high school careers . So , um , one of the things that ended up happening was in their very first exam , almost every student , uh , struggled with the written response , uh , essays . They were in grade 12 , and they were expected to be able to rate , write these essays , um , effectively . And they did not . My highest Mark was 52 . Um , and that was partially my own fault . Um , I had run tutorials but I hadn't made them mandatory . Very few students attended . Um , and their results were a reflection of that . Uh , so what I ended up doing was recognizing that our higher goal of preparing the students for the diploma exam was greater than the , the assessment of this unit exam . And so I allow the students an opportunity to rewrite that in class essay . Um , after having reviewed and gone through detailed feedback for every student , I pulled each one aside and we did a 15 minute conversation about exactly where they were struggling and what their challenges were and what they needed to do to improve their written work . Um , on the second rewrite , uh , the students did much , much better . And I believe that being flexible about our greater goal and achieving that , um , greater goal rather than getting caught up on those small assessments that are meant to be building towards that goal was what allowed us to achieve the objective . In this case , it was a high stressful situation because one of the students was the daughter of a local judge in a small town . Um , and that was a little intimidating . But , uh , in this case , it doesn't pay to be intimidated . Uh , these students need to learn what they need to be able to be doing to be successful at the university level . And so I think we achieved that .","I believe that it's really important to keep the commitments that you make . And I hesitate to make commitments I will be unable to fulfill in my personal life . Um , the balance between work life and personal life , uh , is difficult to , to achieve sometime . And I tend to err on the side of prioritizing work life . However , uh , there was a time when , uh , I had made a commitment , uh , to a group that met every Wednesday evening . Um , and I was leading that group , um , in teaching and in study . And , uh , my objective was to be there every week . And , uh , that commitment was challenged when a work , um , event took place on Wednesday nights . And the work event was an important one . Uh , one that was intended to build relationship between my team and between the parents of kids that were a part of my team , um , and could not be , could not be , uh , worked around . And what I ended up having to do in order to , um , honor the requirements of both commitments was to train up a secondary leader in my volunteer position for the Wednesday night . So my teaching , my training , what I ended up doing was picking somebody from our group who had potential , who had passion , and uh , scaffolding them into a leadership role so that when I have that work commitment and I wasn't able to be there for a day , somebody else was ready and willing to step in . And they did wonderfully . And , uh , it was challenging . And it can be challenging to keep commitments to both work and to your personal life , but it can be done with planning , preparation , and foresight .",4,3.5,4.333333333,4,4
116,P7y23ij-hkef4j,"In my previous job I had I , I was a program coordinator , but it took a lot of project manager roles on within that specific role . At that job in particular , I planned a conference for about 500 or so participants at the conference . It was a very complex environment . It's , we're constantly changing . I had to adapt . You can plan all you want , but things were never going to work out . But the way I was able to make it through this conference multiple times , I have more than one set . I was able to host this conference . It's first of all , a lot of planning . Even though I said plants don't , don't ever work out perfectly . If you don't even have a plan , you're , you're definitely gonna fail . And so I did a lot of planning with there . I had a lot of contingency plans in place and I was able to use that and make things go a lot smoother . Once I actually started , I was also able to rely on my team a lot . I had a few people I was working with . And so when things weren't going to plan , I was able to use people's skill sets and be able to adapt accordingly as needed . And finally , uh , it , it just took a lot of perseverance and dedication on my own part . Uh , didn't really have time to feel bad for myself . If something that plan didn't work out , you just gotta pick yourself up and continue to work . And in the end , these , uh , these big things that seemed like such a big deal to me , um , nobody else even really notice , right ? They're very small things and overall people seem to have a great time at the events as a whole . And so it really just took a lot of know , just persevering and planning , relied on team members . And through that I was able , uh , to , to adapt to a change in a complex environment at work . This was definitely more about micro scenario as opposed to macro scenario , but I think that still really showcases my skillset . I have . Thank you .","In my current role , uh , I've been assigned to be the project manager for a big project . We're working on implementing a new grant management system and we're given extremely tight timelines to finish that . And I had zero experience working with this organization . Zero experiences in grant management systems in particular . What I did is actually was able to register using some professional development dollars into a grant management course or starting about grant management project management course . And uh , using those abilities and the templates and things I was given through that course , I was able to , to set reasonable , realistic and smart goals for myself . Um , especially using that smart acronym there . Uh , and so there I was able to create a project management plan . I was able to work , uh , with my supervisor having good progress meetings , uh , making assignments for team members . Again , used left that project plan I was able to create and uh , we were able to get everything turned around in extremely tight Thailand's there . Uh , yeah , I had particular , I had to have certain things ready for Christmas , which was really hard . Uh , you know , trying to get people to , to complete their tasks when there's a hundred other deadlines I had to work on . But because everyone had the expectations clearly laid out in front of them , myself included , we're able to achieve our goal . Thank you .","I actually took a class at the university that was all about working as a team and a part of the team . We had weekly labs where we had to accomplish different projects together , uh , any . Anyway , so one of these projects that we're working on , uh , we , uh , there was a lab , uh , TA , that's the terminology for them . There's a TA that gave out some instructions , but there's also larger instructions from , uh , from the professor . Long story short , we got two different types of instructions that weren't fully aligned and we had to , uh , by the end of the slab to complete this project that we're working on . Uh , the lab itself , I don't remember the full length . I would say there are only about an hour or so . And we , we didn't know quite what our goals were supposed to be or all the project details cause there was some conflicting information . Ultimately , as it was a teamwork class . Uh , we , uh , we just kind of , you know , decided what we thought was most important , what the direction of thought was . We were supposed to go , uh , just the way things were laid out , we weren't actually able to get additional clarification , just how things were . So we ended up having just to make what we thought was the best decision . Just do some , um , just , uh , used what we consider was to be the best course of option . It turns out it was all part of a larger plan that the prophet , the TA set up together . There was supposed to be all this information . They're teaching us a larger lesson on , you know , uh , taking the lead and making decisions and working together as a team , especially with the lack of information . And yeah , that was just one of the times day . Thank you .","So I remember my first year of university , I was out of high school for about three years at this point . And I was , even though I was out of high school for a while , I was more used to how high school was managed . And so by that I mean teachers always told you when your deadlines were , they told you when you had a big exam , they told you this but told you that . Well , and university , a university I went to , they didn't tell you that information . They give you the syllabus and you're expected to plan it out yourself . So at that point I was just kind of going along , I'm like , wow , this is great that there weren't any assignments do this , that it turns out I missed a few major , well , not major assignments that are worth a couple of percent of my grade . And before I knew it , uh , the following week I had , I believe it was three midterms . I don't remember the exact amount , but there were all consecutive days and I hadn't started studying or anything . And I was like , wow , I'm screwed . How am I going to do this here ? I ended up having to make a little project plan . I didn't know that's what I was doing at the time . A little study schedule for myself . I , I had to cancel some plans . Um , and yeah , I really had to do like an hourly breakdown of my time in order to get everything done and that's , and it was super stressful . Time ended up passing all those classes doing really good and some of them I could've done better if I knew about assignments . I had more time to study , but it taught me a Bible lesson . And uh , every time after that and university , uh , to start off the term , I would put all my important dates in my cell phone , have like notifications to remind me a month out , two weeks out a week out , all those kind of , you know , various reminders and I was able to stay on top of everything . I , my time management skills improved a lot . I , I did end up doing a lot better in school . I ended up actually graduated with honors or um , with distinction and yeah . And so , you know , it was a stressful time . It , they'll come ended up being pretty good and the longterm outcome ended up being amazing for me . Thank you .","So , uh , in particularly this question , you talked about commitments but it wasn't fully laid out if it was supposed to be commitments related to personal life to work . Uh , I am gonna take a little bit of Liberty with this and I talk about personal life commitments . I talked about previously what I was doing the job where I was planning conferences . Now the things about those conferences is they either overlapped with my birthday or they happen just before , just after it was red . Around that time and anybody who's ever planned a conference knows , uh , they can become straight , quite stressful to the point where it kind of occupied my time when I was in working and when I was outside of work . It was just mentally just taking up a lot of space there . Now one year , one of my good friends wanted to , to celebrate my birthday with me and I originally ended up having to cancel . Um , it was just , I was a little too stressed with work and my friend was quite disappointed . Um , uh , I felt like I let them down . It was not something I really wanted to do . I then took some time just to kind of reorganize my priorities in life . While work is very important to me , my , my friendships and relationships are just as important , actually more important . So I was able to just rework my schedule a little bit , be able to still create those birthday plans with my friends . Uh , had a great time . Um , everybody was happy and I was still able to what my opinion , put out a great conference . And that was the time I just kind of had to prioritize both the work life balance in there . Maybe not quite what you're asking . And I do apologize if I took too much creative Liberty there , but , uh , I just , how I w I wanted to answer this one . Thank you .",3,3,2.666666667,3.666666667,2.333333333
117,Pfsivny-6hcutr,"Hi . So this question actually is really revelent to what's happened to us in the last , um , several years with COBIT . We do projects in schools and when COBIT hit , the first thing that happened is that our schools shut down . Um , or they stopped allowing outside vendors and people into the schools , into classrooms . And that's how we get our work done is meeting with students and , um , doing our programs . So , um , yeah , we had to immediately , um , address this and figure out what we're going to do . So obviously like everybody else , we became , um , very high tech . We download , we signed up for some zoom accounts and we , um , we actually spent a great deal of time transferring all of our presentations into zoom presentations . Um , it was , it was a lot of work . And the other thing is the platforms kept changing all the time . Um , different , everybody had a different platform was a different way of using it . The schools would start one and then they start the other . So there were a lot of changes with us . Um , and we just kept up with the flow with what schools were doing . And eventually , um , I think everyone kind of calmed down and it came to zoom and we were able to put everything into a PowerPoint and do the presentations virtually . So it was a quick learn for us . We had a lot of new technology thrown at us . Um , and we just quickly adapted to , we would , um , to get through this . We would train staff , we work together , we practice with each other , um , to get the presentations out there . And that worked . We also , two other things we did is we had to come up once we have these presentations done , then we heard from our schools that they didn't want , um , any more presentations that the kids were tired and burned out . So we had a , um , we just did a group think session and we came up with this virtual game where we would text information to students and then they would have to search it on their own . Um , quick fun things and we'd get , cause we can do by texts , we could get back to them quickly that yes , you got the question right or no , he didn't get the question right . Keep searching . Um , so we had to come up with some fun things too . And we , again , we just did this by , um , group meetings , not being afraid to try something and getting an out there . Um , our only problem was with our grandparent group . They were not quite as , um , quick to adapt the technology that their students had that their grandkids had . Um , so we had , again , figure out how we could reach our grandparent population . And we did that by coming up with packets that we could distribute in carpool line were allowed to be outside our schools . We just couldn't go into the schools , so we could hand each grandparent a packet that had all our information and then we asked their grandkids to take a picture when it was done and send it to us . So , um , it's been a lot of fun and I think that we will .","So we had a project where we had 13 students that we were funding and we wanted to increase the number of students that we could fund . So to do this , the students had to apply for our scholarship and then the scholarships , then the applications were evaluated and we wanted to choose the top performers of the scholarship , um , for students to receive funding . Um , well we had such a low response to our , um , scholarship that we didn't think that we were actually reaching the high performing group that we wanted to reach . So , um , the first goal was to increase the amount of the students applying for a scholarship and to increase the number of students receiving our scholarship . So what we had to do , number one is to find some outreach , get the word out that we actually had the scholarship that it had existed . And two was very specific to some certain populations . So we really had to target that population . And we did this , um , by finding partners that were very connected to this , these student populations and setting up , um , outreach sessions . Uh , again , it was during , um , coven . So we really couldn't , our , our , um , population were already in college and we couldn't go to colleges and do , um , fun sessions there . So we actually had to get the students to come to us . We did that through zoom sessions . So we got the partners that already had these students and we asked them to help us recruit students , log on to , um , our zoom sessions . We made them fun , we made them interactive , we made them fairly short and we could give them all the information and we actually help walk them through the application . We made sure that our application , um , the timeline was that we did the outreach , but that our application was up and running . So at the end of the session , the students could log onto the computers and we would still be there , available on zoom to help him with any questions as they went through the application process . And it was very successful . I think we raised a number of applications by like 70% , um , which then gave us a greater pool of students , um , to choose from . So worked out really well .","So this question goes back to a time we had make a quick change and then it goes back to Covin cause we had so many changes and so many things going on at the time . But , um , we had to make a quick decision of how we could present our programs in the schools . Um , our funding or if we were funded based on the number of presentations we did and if we couldn't reach the students , we , we would lose our funding . So we had our still reaches students . Um , and um , the conflicting information is that every school and every person we talked to told us there'd be a different way that we could present the information . So you could do it on this platform , you could do it on that platform . Um , we just , we had many different conflicting groups telling us what was working , what wouldn't work . So what we did is we researched everything and found the most con , the most compatible platform . We decided instead of setting up our project for different platforms , we would just convert all of our information into , uh , a PowerPoint document . And then that could be shown on any type of , um , of platform with the schools . Um , also we found out that we really couldn't , it was hard for us to do it from the outside . Not all the platforms would work for us logging into the school system . So we had to made sure that we had , um , a contact within the school who could show the presentation . And , um , it worked . It was very successful and we were able to do our present , continue our presentations .","So when I first started my job at the foundation , one of the things that I had overseeing was a scholarship they had set up with our local university and go through the file . I saw that there were three parameters . One that it was a scholarship for students that the foundation wanted to help give additional money to students too , that they were going to help be on the selection committee and help select these students that receive the scholarship and three , the university promise that they would provide matching funds , um , for , for the scholarship so that it would grow and more money it would be available for students . So in looking through the file , I saw that none of those actions , none of those commitments were being done by the university . So , um , high pressure , it was time for the next scholarship round . And I'm uncomfortable is I had to point this out to the university that they weren't and find out what they were doing , why they weren't doing their commitment . So I met with our liaison and first thing I found out was that , um , they couldn't supplant , they were supplanting our funds with regular funding . In other words , the student received our scholarship . They would really receive less scholarship money from the school and the school then would distribute that funding to other students . Um , yes , more students were being helped , but this was not what our board actually envisioned . Um , but it was also tied up into federal guidelines and rules . So it was really not something , even though it was promised to us , it was not something that we could , um , do much about , which was okay . I just had to then explain that all to the board . Um , and I did that by letting them see that they had , we're still helping students just not exactly in the manner they , they had thought they were . Um , second issue was selection of students that they wanted to be part of the selection committee and that was not allowed by rules of the university . So , um , what I did then is I met with a university and we kind of brainstorm some ways around this and what we agreed on was that I would be a part of the selection committee . I just would not be able to vote . And this was okay because it gave our board at least the information that they wanted that they could see the selection was being done in a proper manner . So that was okay . The third one was the most challenging and that , um , the university was not receiving any matching funds and at that point they admitted to us that , um , that they probably would be no matching funds coming . So I had to bring that back to our ward . Again , high , high pressure , very stressful , um , that their , their scholarship was not being , uh , instituted in the manner that they thought it was . And it was at that point that we show the university that since they had not done any of their three commitments , that we were going to pull , pull the funding , which we did . It worked out okay . Because the university was able to see that it was not us pulling the money that they had some part to it .","Well , I really don't have any specific situations I can share about this other than I try to prevent this from happening at any time . Um , you know , I have a pretty , I'm very well organized and I keep my commitments on my calendar . Um , very clear to me . Um , I would always , anything that would involve funding or money or a penalty would always be my first priority . And also what I do is when I get a situation , when I get very busy or there's , we're understaffed and there's too much work to do , I sit down with our management and I lay out the committees and the timeline and we just kind of reprioritize where my efforts should be . Um , so everybody's were aware of it and it doesn't become that I haven't met a deadline . We have just looked at the schedule and reprioritized everything and come up with new deadlines so that , um , something just may be pushed out a little bit further if something comes up . But , um , you know , our , our , our , our profession , anything can change at any time , so you always have to be aware of these things . So , um , the worst thing to do , in my opinion , is not to do anything and then let all your commitments be late . But I think if you stay on top of them , um , and just communicate with others that , um , that people seem to be okay with that and much better to know than , than just to be late .",4,3.5,3,3.666666667,3.333333333
118,P249dud-45ahgz,"Um , one time that I've had to adopt is I was working on a project that had a , um , very quick timeline , um , and had to be done in a couple of months and it was a larger budget or I'm sorry , it was a smaller budget . So I had to make sure that I got the product going and it also had quite a few people that were managing different parts of the project . So it required me , um , to make sure that I was communicating with everyone and keeping everyone in the loop . Um , and that's basically what I did . Um , I was very organized , so I made sure every item that was spent was tracked to the budget state exactly where it was needed . Um , I made sure that I was in constant contact with every point person who was managing some part of the project . That way we made sure everyone , um , knew what was going on . Everyone knew what was expected . Um , and there were no unknown surprises . Um , we were also able to get the job done by the deadline that wasn't originally presented . Um , and most of that , again , came from the really great communication that I practiced with every point person . So we all knew what , what to expect .","Um , I had set a goal for a project on making sure that I stayed on track in the budget and I had set these goals because the budget was extremely strict and it was going to be challenging for me , um , because I would have to find ways to get creative , um , to make sure that I stood within the budget that was presented . Um , I was able to do this by , um , talking with a lot of the different people who were in the project , um , and working with them and seeing on ways that on things that we could do to save money but not mess with the quality of the project . Um , I also was also able to , Yeah , Find different companies to work with that actually had a better price than ones that we had originally thought . Um , and that was a way that we were able to stay within the budget . Um , and I was also able to , Um , Work with the person who wanted the budget done and get with them on things that they could do too . Mmm . Make the dollar go more on this project . And because of those various things , we were able to stay within the budget for the project . Correct .","Um , I was working on a project where the , um , there was a deadline approaching for the floors , um , and it needed to be had in within the next five minutes . Um , the issue that we were faced with was , um , one person was saying that the owner had requested this , um , very red hardwood floor and a couple , another couple was saying that it was a gray floor and then there were someone's , someone else who had said that they wanted a tile floor that looked like wood . Um , so essentially I had five minutes to try to figure out what exactly it was that the owner wanted . Um , I did try to reach out to them , but they didn't answer . So luckily I was able to go back into my email because I had organized and saved all of the communications there and I was easily able to see the last update that we had gotten on the flooring that the owner had requested , um , which ended up being the tile Woodgreen floor . And I was able to get that in on time that way . Um , it could be ordered and it can be brought here and it wouldn't end up delaying the timeline for the project .","Um , there was a time at school when we had finals approaching . Um , and I had , um , a day where I had two different finals . Um , I also was still in , um , basketball . So I had practice that I had to do . And on top of that I ended up catching a really bad cold , so I was feeling very under the weather . Um , and I had a fever . So luckily , um , I was able to deal with it because I did not wait until the last minute to study , so I had , was very prepared for the exam , so I just spent a few minutes for each test going over them , make sure I had everything , um , for basketball practice again . Um , I had never really missed any practices up to this point . Um , so I was able to go , but , um , because I had been so studious on going to every practice , the coach was fine with me taking a little bit easy . Um , and luckily I was able to go to sleep on time . Um , I got a lot of rest and I ended up doing a great job on my finals .","Um , there was a day when I was supposed to be meeting with the owner and some of the more important contact people on a project that I was working on . Um , I did end up having to let the manager know or let the owner know that I wasn't going to be able to make that meeting . Um , and the reason why is that there ended up being a problem that was occurring with some of the products that we had ordered . Um , and so we had , um , they were going to end up not being able to be come in on time . And so we had to , um , basically come up with some new ideas . So I ended up having to meet with the designer so we could hurry up and pick out some new products that went with the design , um , inspo that the owner had . Um , and I was able to communicate with everyone , let them know what , what occurred . Um , and they ended up being okay . And luckily the designer and I were able to order some items that would be in , on time .

Um , I am currently a teacher , but I look forward to furthering my career as a project manager . Um , I started the year as a third and fourth grade special education teacher , but due to some actions by others in my field or in my department I should say . Um , I am now having to take on fifth graders as well on my caseload . So my caseload is now very big . I'm now at I think 15 students total . Um , when other caseload's are around 10 to like five to 10 . So my caseload is the largest of the school . Um , I've had to adapt by changing my schedule around . Um , I need to maximize my time with the students to meet their needs . I have been able to do that . So , um , I have been able to be flexible with my scheduling and my pooling of the students and rely on my , um , on my other teachers , on the people . I work with , staff members to also be flexible in their time and allowing me to pull the students when I need to . So I've been able to adapt in that way and it has been very positive for my students . They seem to be happy and I am happy in my new role as well .","A recent project that I can think of that I had to set goals for was whenever I decided to get my master's degree . Um , as a teacher you are required to get a certain amount of credits each , um , every few years to in order to keep your certification . A lot of people choose to just go ahead and get their master's degree , um , which comes with a pay raise . And then the flexibility and possibilities of other job opportunities . I chose to , as I said , get my masters . I met with many different , um , educational planners from different colleges in order to set up my schedule . I had made the plan and the goals that I wanted to complete this master's degree in two years . Um , with that I was required to take about three classes per semester and a couple of classes in the summer . Um , I had to be very diligent in my work ethic because I not only had my full time job , I also had the classes . Um , I had my family , I was , I had a lot going on , so I was able to meet my goals and I completed all of the classes and I did fine with my job and everything , and I am so happy how it turned out . I have my master's , I now have the flexibility and the possibilities , so I'm very happy with how it turned out .","Um , a situation that I had to make an important decision . So in my job , I make decisions all day , every day . I get a million questions a day . As you can imagine working with students , children , um , I'm constantly making decisions . They're not always like super important , but um , they are decisions constantly . But one specific time in which I needed to make an important decision very quickly was , um , whenever we went into a lockdown , so it locked down is whenever you close the door , you lock the door , you keep all the students silent . Um , and that could be because there's an intruder in the building or you know , a student has a weapon . Um , which is the case that happened in this situation that I will discuss . So , um , that did happen . We went into a lockdown . I had to make the very important decision quickly to find my students and keep them in the room . You do have a decision now during lockdown you can either hide , fight or run . So I made the decision to hide because in the lockdown information there was conflicting information . So it was very unclear where you're getting different information from different teachers about what was really going on , because that can be , that was the first time this has ever been a real thing . We do drills all the time , but it was a real thing . So we didn't know exactly what to do . I made the decision to get my students and to hide essentially . So we stayed in my classroom . Um , it was a very scary situation , but we were there together . It ended up there being a student had a weapon . Um , the police came , it was dealt with , it was fine , and I made the right decision . So I am happy with that and that's my story .","This question just happens to go right along with my last one about my situation of the lockdown . So I think I would consider that my high pressure or stressful situation . Um , there was a student , it ended up a student had a weapon . Um , nothing happened as in no one got hurt . The police were called . We had to go into a lockdown . Um , we were very scared . My students and I , however , I couldn't let them know I was scared because that would make it even worse . That would make them even more scared . And it's just a whole , you know , a whole domino effect of that . So I responded being very calm . I , um , kept them calm . Um , I was trying to be very loving and understanding , but also in a calming nature . The lockdown lasted for about an hour and a half . So we were in the room , um , silent and except for maybe like a little bit of whispering because we really didn't know what was going on . Um , we were getting conflicting information . Well , I was getting conflicting information from different teachers and they weren't , administration wasn't telling us anything . So I chose to respond in a calm manner in order to not , you know , make my students even more scared . Um , the outcome was positive because they , I think they relate to , they relate their emotions to how the adults in the room are feeling . And , um , it was beneficial to them for me to react that way . So it was , it ended up being a very positive experience .","Um , my job currently has various levels of commitments , um , things that I have to address . Um , at being a special educator . I have their IEP too , right ? That is a huge commitment . That is probably my number one commitment I have to address , um , their goals and I have to collect data on their goals . That would also be a number one commitment because this is a legal document and it is um , very important that it stays up to date and the needs of the document are being met . I also have commitments to my non special ed students who I see regularly for math and for reading . I also have commitments of interventions , um , that I have small groups of students come for reading and math interventions every day . I have commitments to . Um , and those are all , those would all be number one commitments . Uh , maybe some that are a little bit lower that I do have a commitment to but they don't always happen . Our team meetings . So I personally am now on three , I'm sorry , four different teams . I am on a third grade team , a fourth grade team , the special ed team . And now , as I talked about in my , um , first question , I am now on the fifth grade team . Uh , these teams meet weekly to discuss , you know , what's , what's going on in the classroom and any updates . It is very hard for me to meet those commitments because of my other priorities that I have discussed . Um , so those , I don't always make all of the meetings , but my team members are very kind to me and they give me any notes that I missed or any important information . But that is a difficulty of mine because I just don't have enough time .",3.333333333,2.333333333,3.666666667,3.666666667,2.333333333
120,Prg6qna-evpgqj,"This was when I was a student job , um , holder . So I was in a hospital setting during the pandemic , uh , and in the fall of 2020 just adopting with different PPE , um , different situations and protocols of what was happening when , um , patients were diagnosed with coven , um , because I was dealing with mental health rather than physical health . So we only found out sometimes if , um , they did have Cobra , they only get tested sometimes depending on what the outcome was . But as the vaccines rolled out , um , I kind of had to step up and advocate for myself in the situation because the hospital I was at was not offering , um , vaccinations for students , uh , who are patient facing as I was , I was going into spaces with COBIT positive patients , um , unvaccinated and as a student not being compensated . So , um , I had to figure out my own resources to be vaccinated and I reached out to my health department as well as my university and pieced together how to get vaccinated to feel safe in the work environment . And I think throughout COBIT , it was just a really difficult , um , and turbulent environment in general . There were a lot of changes that were happening , but I think that overall learning more about how to advocate for myself as well as be flexible in those situations was really , um , a worthwhile outcome .","So the project I'll describe as more of , um , the steps leading to an outcome or a goal , I would call it . I would say it falls into the category of a project in general . Um , but not maybe in the , in the typical sense . Um , I was planning out when and how to take my licensure exam for the occupation that I have and took a lot of preparation and I had kind of said the idea that first I would submit , um , an application to be able to sit for the test . Um , and from there kind of plan out my timeline . So once I had done that , I decided I would study and give myself at least a full month . I was coming fresh out of school , so I didn't feel I needed as much time to maybe prepare as if I , um , had been out of the practice for a longer amount of time . So then came the decision of whether to take the exam before or after my graduation date , which was a very tricky decision to make . And I had to wait some options and figure out if I would be prepared enough to take it before my graduation date , um , or if I'd have to wait and kind of be stressed about it on my graduation date and take it afterwards . So ultimately I decided to take it before and I also made the decision to not tell any of my peers or , um , friends , family , anybody that I was taking the exam . Um , or what day I was taking it to not have that added pressure . The only person who knew was the , um , hiring manager at the place that I was hoping to be hired at once I was licensed . So , um , it ended up going very well . I passed on my first attempt and I think that really thinking through things and planning it out was helpful to achieve my goal .","So I worked as an acute mental health screener at a hospital . And coming from a mental health perspective and a mental health profession , my outlook and understanding of clients or patients who are experiencing suicidal ideation is very different from those who may be , are less experienced , uh , in that mental health and what leads to that and how to deal with it in general . Um , so from a medical standpoint , um , but the situation I was working in was in a hospital doing screenings to um , assess whether a patient would need to go to an inpatient facility , meaning they would go to an acute , um , five day average stay at a facility . They would stay the night and get intensive care , um , do medication adjustments , those sorts of things . And there was one client who was really strongly experiencing suicidal ideation with a plan and intent , um , and really wanted to follow through on their plan . So that client was pretty young . First sort of experience with any sort of ideation was very terrified . And kind of in those situations is when , as a mental health professional , you have to make the call . Um , cam , is this kid more safe , um , going home or is this , is this parent more safe going home ? Is this sibling , is this , is this person safe going home , um , or safer going home than they would be to go inpatient ? Meaning would it be a more traumatic experience going in patient ? Cause it is a very different experience . Being removed from your home is a very difficult thing to go through . So medical professionals were , for lack of better word , scared to allow the patient to go home . And while from my perspective , I was seeing it as it would have been a more traumatic experience for them to go inpatient and they had all the measures to be able to stay safe at home . They had supports , they had means to restrict or they could do means restriction . They could lock up anything that was dangerous or posting any danger or quick access to lethal means . So , um , kind of had to push for advocating for that client even though , uh , my position was not regarded on the same knowledge or authority level as the medical professionals in this situation . And we ended up sending the patient home and we do follow up calls over the next couple of weeks . We did find out that the patient was doing very well and was thankful for having someone who could advocate for them , so it ended up well . Okay .","I see a lot of , um , highly suicidal clients in the role that I have currently . And there was a particular situation where my client was expressing high , high , high levels of suicidal ideation with intent and plan and there's also a time constraint because they , as I , I had asked about it earlier in this , in the time that we were meeting and towards the end of the meeting was when they said , actually I didn't answer those questions honestly and kind of went back on what they were saying to express it . They were feeling pretty highly suicidal . And um , I did have a client coming in after them who I was meeting with and had to make a quick decision on delegating some responsibilities . So I reached out and asked for some help from a coworker who was able to come and see the current client I was with while I met with the next client . And then when I was done , I was able to kind of circle back around and they ended up being great . It actually was a very refreshing fit for this coworker to be able to meet with my client for that amount of time . Um , it gave them a kind of an additional voice to say the same things that I had been saying as they were more familiar with me . So I think it provided a refreshing outcome and they are doing well . And I have developed quite a few good coping skills and I think have had a pretty significant reduction in suicidal ideation .","I have recurring appointments standing with a lot of clients and , um , I had made a mistake and forgotten to go in on one of my clients and I guess renew the recurring session . So they ran out , um , when I was looking ahead at scheduling more clients and I called a , um , a client and offer them a spot that I did not realize was already taken and schedule them out . And they had expressed a lot of gratitude for scheduling cause they had been waiting for a long time to get scheduled and , um , had a long conversation about how important it was . And I ended up having to go back and call them and say , you know what ? I messed this up and I'm so sorry about it . Here are some options we have for moving forward . And they were very appreciative of the fact that I was honest and said , you know , this was my mistake . I messed this up . Um , and took the steps to be able to fix it so it ended up all right .",3,3,4,3.75,2.666666667
121,P4wyput-2fm6pu,"So there was this one time when I was working in my project manager role in another organization . Uh , and at this time there was a very high turnover , um , in terms of those asphalt units that I was leading and guiding and providing support to during this project . Um , with that said , because there was that high turnover , it meant that a lot of the projects we were working on in the initiatives within the projects , um , we're , you know , uh , being delayed and there was a lot of things that you had to adapt to in terms of new personalities on the team . Um , you know , new skillsets that we weren't aware that people had and , um , different , you know , different ways that people worked . So the first thing that I get as a project manager is I made sure to sit down with each new person on the team and really get a sense of what their , you know , um , skills work to see where I could best utilize them . Um , and then also letting them know that this is an environment right now that is going to be something we all have to adapt to . Um , and encouraging them and letting them know that I'm here for them to see and to support them and provide them with that , um , really great support . So that was one of the ways that I , uh , took some steps to do that and other , uh , way that I took steps to , um , do , you know , help in adapting was providing additional resources for my , uh , those that I was leading and guiding , um , as well as making sure that clients were aware of , you know , the complexities of things that were working , but also assuring them that we were going to meet those deadlines and timelines that we promised them that we would . So , uh , all of this really , um , helped in ensuring that we were able to adapt to those changes within our work environment . Um , you know , we were able to make sure that every employee , um , with , you know , working on this project was up to par and knew all of the information and was able to meet their deadlines , um , as , as , as you know , as accurately and efficiently as possible . So the outcome really , um , showed me that the things that I did really helped , um , you know , support this , uh , these initiatives and in adapting . Um , and I feel like another big thing that I utilized during this whole process to adapt was , you know , adapting my communication style depending on who I was talking to , to be able to best support them . Um , whether that was someone that I was , you know , guiding and leading , or whether that was a client who was inquiring about something . Uh , you know , I also made sure to let my team know that I could take on additional resources if needed . However , of course , I don't want to overexert myself , so , you know , so making sure that there's work life balance there . But overall , I feel like this was a really , um , great time that I learned how to effectively manage , um , others and how to actually adapt myself and how to help others adapting complex and changing environments .","So , um , in my past roles as a project manager , um , of course setting goals is something that we deal with constantly . And unfortunately as a result of that , there is oftentimes where it's hard to meet these goals and you know , there are obstacles and challenges that come up as a result of that . So in this one particular instance , the situation I was working at this company and we were going to be implementing a new system into the , um , with the current system that they had . So they were at one point , we were moving them to the 2.0 . So within this project , of course we had a lot of goals that were set , but one of those goals mainly , uh , was that , uh , implementation date that it was going to go wise . And so the timeline that we had for all of this was quite tight . Within that we had a few employees who were going on leaves , which meant that the capacity within our team was going to be less and we have to find new staff to cover these leaves , um , while they were gone . So because of all that , there was a lot of , you know , um , obstacles obviously that we were facing out within this . So the actions that I took specifically within this situation was I first met with the rest of the team that was still there and I kind of tried to just get a sense of where everyone's head was at , what they were feeling and how confident they felt and their ability to meet the current deadlines and goals that we had as a team . You know , I shared with them my own concerns and I was honest and we had a really great conversation about what things we could do as a team and what things I could do as their project manager to best support them in moving forward . So one of the things that we decided as a result of this is that every day I would do a quick check in meeting with them and we'd all just kind of quickly check , see where everyone's at and if there was anything that I could assist with because I had some capacity that day or someone else on the team had capacity would step in and support that person as needed . It's not really helped us in , in , you know , meeting these goals and these deadlines because they were very tight . Another part of the actions that I took in helping the situation and meet these goals and why they were so hard to achieve is because we were also dealing with a budget . And you know , again , these , these timelines of things that we can only do so much of and we have to have the capacity to be able to do this . With that said , what we were able to do is actually , um , I was able to , because of the capacity of my team or my people that I was leading and guiding , uh , I was actually able to , you know , give them a little bit more , um , work , which they were happy to take on , um , because I had that conversation with them . And so because of that , it freed up a little bit of my ability actually to go and make sure that I was taking the time to hire some new staff members who are going to effectively support the team in the initiatives we were taking so that we could meet the goal . So , uh , as a result , of course we did meet our goal . It was tough and there were some times where we felt discouraged , but as a project manager I felt it was my , um , my responsibility to support the team and empower them and encourage them and motivate them in any way that I could . Um , and to also let them know that I'm just as much a part of this team as they are . Um , although I'm the man at the project manager , they're , you know , I'm , I'm leading and guiding them and , you know , their success is my success . So at the end of the day , uh , it was , it was great . We were able to meet that .","Yeah , absolutely . So , um , I find the decision making is an extremely important thing . Um , and one of the biggest things as a project manager is that I do have to be able to make quick sound decisions because there are lots of decisions and quite important decisions , um , that have to be made with , you know , um , in the moment or with very little time to , you know , actually get the research and data behind that and you know , know if you're making the best decision possible for the project and the initiatives . So there was this one particular instance where I was working on a project , had a specific organization and I had a couple different , um , of my , you know , uh , team members who I was guiding and leading come to me and let me know , um , some information about the research they've been doing . Um , and you know , what they provided me was quite contradictory . So one of them had provided information that told us , um , that if we went in the direction we were thinking of when we were going to be over budget and that was going to be a very difficult thing for us if we were especially for , you know , as a product plan for . It's very important that I keep us in budget . Um , and the other , you know , had some information that said actually would be under budget if we went forward with what we were doing . So looking at this information , um , on , in that moment , these two came to me and they basically said to me , which one is right ? And so I had an important decision to make there . And that decision was , do I provide a specific answer to this right here or do I say , Hey , you know what ? I really appreciate and value the work that you've put in . I want to take a little bit of time , maybe just even half hour to an hour just to sit and review just so that I can make sure that I'm giving you guys the right answer . And so that we can all move forward as best as possible . So I , you know , like that's how I decided . I quickly basically based on my understanding of and my intuition , I said , you know , these are very talented and understanding individuals within the team and they're both just trying to do what's best for the project . And because of that , I knew that I would be able to , if I made that decision to say , Hey , instead of , you know , causing a division between the team and actually moving forward and just taking a little bit more time that we could actually find a solution that would work best for all of us . So the outcome of the final decision was that I took some time to analyze that information just a little bit more . And what I found is that actually there was truth to both of the information that they had found . There was things that were true within the information , however , it was just how they were interpreting the data . So with that said , I , I brought us all back together and said , Hey , you know what , if we all chat about this , I set up a meeting , kind of , we can kind of go over this a bit more and maybe we bring a few more people in to get a different perspective . At the end of the day , we were able to realize that we wouldn't actually be over budget . However , there was a , there was a chance of that if X , Y and Z happened . So at the end of the day , it was a great experience and I learned a lot and I learned , um , to just go with your gut at the end of the day .","As a product manager , I think it's really important to be able to cope and manage high stress , high pressure situations . I think , you know , working within projects that have tight deadlines and timelines , it's inevitable that that's going to happen and they're going to come across something like that . So it's really important that you're able to manage your stress , um , and you know , your own , you know , um , where you're at and where your feelings that you're able to support others within the project team as well . With that said , there was this one specific instance where I was responsible for ensuring that all of the products that we had procured for this project were arrived arriving on time . And there was a lot of pressure in this situation because if I , if this stuff wasn't delivered by this specific date , then we weren't going to be able to go live by our go live date . So with that said , there was a lot of pressure , a lot of stress on me to make sure that this was something that was done . So I'm ensured that I first of all took the initiative myself to kind of understand , you know , why this was such an important piece to the work that we were doing . You know , and making sure that the people that were procuring these services and products from , we're also aware of of that and that , uh , you know , to let them know and be quite transparent with them saying , Hey , look , we really need this by this date . And making sure to start sooner rather than later as well . Not , you know , putting it off as well . Another thing that could just be followed up . So after , you know , making sure that we put in that order , I followed up once I had , if I , once I hadn't heard back from them , it was a little bit , so I wanted to make sure that things were still on track to be delivered by a specific date . We ended up finding out the things weren't going to be delivered by that date and it was going to be delayed . So at that point I took some more time to , uh , you know , obviously that wasn't stressful , but I took some time and I , you know , took some deep breaths , reminded myself that , you know , everything is going to work out . Um , I have a team that supports me and that at the end of the day , you know , some of this is out of my hands , but there's more stuff that I can do and I'm going to do that . So that's what I did . I connected with my team for a little bit of support and then I followed up and I made sure to , um , not only follow up , but say , Hey , you know , if it can't be delivered by this date , is there other options for us to get it delivered by that date ? If we're not going to have it go by train , say we're going to pay for the air airfare instead of the train . So all that , all that to say , we at the end of the day , we're actually able to come to an agreement with the person , uh , the services . And we were able to get them to deliver it by that specific date via a different route . Um , and they actually decided to comp the cost for us because they understood that was actually their fault for not being able to deliver it by that date . So all that was really great and it reminded me that , you know , even when things are going hard in that it's tough . It's an opportunity . It's not a challenge . It's an opportunity . And I felt very , I felt , uh , successful and I felt excited about what other things I could do to help this project . Um , and not only that , but everyone else was excited and we were able to meet our go live date .","Absolutely . So again , as a project manager , if there are oftentimes where you're going to have lots of competing deadlines , lots of different tasks , and you're gonna have made commitments and it may be that you're not able to make a certain commitment that you've made because of other more , um , you know , urgent work that has presented itself . So there was this instance where , um , I decided to step up and become the president of our social committee . So at work , I , you know , I wanted to make sure that I was , you know , getting involved and I wanted to not only , you know , just be the project manager , but also , you know , show others that , um , it's OK to , you know , have fun and reduce that stress level , especially within those high stress environments . So the issue with this is , as president , I , you know , I committed to a whole bunch of different responsibilities , especially one of which was meeting every week and running those meetings and making sure that I was following up with people and all of the , you know , things that we promise as a committee to do were happening . And to the best of our ability happening and that they were actually exciting and something that , that those in our organization wanted . So there we were working on a specific part of this project and our go live date was a month out . And so at this point we did have an event coming up for a social committee and I wasn't able to meet the commitment of going to those meetings every week and our experience difficulty with that because , um , there was a few weeks where I wasn't able to go just because of the workload . And I communicated that to my team beforehand and everyone was extremely understanding at the vice president , you know , stood up and you know , took that , took that work on while I was off . But then I , you know , I , I had told myself I was going to make sure that I was at the next two because these were the themes of the two before our event . So I did have some difficulty doing this . But the biggest thing for me is to do lists , you know , writing out a to do list of all the things I have to do and then ranking them , you know , putting little color coats by them or numbers as to what's the most important , what's the priority , what are the steps ? And so when I see it visually on that page , I know , okay , perfect . And it's really easy for me to get going and do that . Another way to do this is I removed distractions from myself . So it could be just putting some headphones in to drawn out some of the other noise within the office that I can get some work done , whatever that looks like , I'm willing to do that . Um , other times it's just , you know , saying , Hey , you know what , I have some opportunity over here . Um , I'm going to , you know , take this , these five minutes . I haven't just worked on this other fin . So a lot of it was just really being flexible , working around , um , and connecting with others and being honest and transparent with them about the workload that I was experiencing . But that I was also absolutely able to handle it . And I just , you know , might have a little bit more on my plate right now , but I was definitely going to be able to make that all that to say I was able to make the last meetings before event and I wasn't even able to attend the event . I'll also mean all of my work deadlines . Um , and I felt very supported by my team . Uh , not just the committee , but my team within the product as well . Um , and by working together and , um , you know , really writing things out and being honest , it was a great experience . I learned a lot .",4.333333333,3.666666667,3.666666667,4.333333333,3.333333333
122,Pfw7hui-fzab8c,"A time that I had to adapt to a complex work environment . Um , as a previous experience as a project manager , there was a project that was not , uh , agreeable amongst my other colleagues . So to adapt to that , we had a team meeting in the morning and we all sat together to kind of come together with all the disagreements we had per that project . And it was very helpful that we decided to come together cause we , uh , came to agreement on ways to tweak the project into , um , a way that ended up benefiting the outcome of said project .","Um , a time that we had a set goals for a project that are very hard is meeting , um , company standards , which are sometimes on achievable , but to , um , the actions that we took was trying to get the team together knowing that we had to make the end result the best that it can be . But just trying not to put too much pressure on our team to know that it is a fun activity and that it is not the end of the world if the project does not come out the best . So that way , um , they're , they're doing something that they want to do and they like to do . So it ended up being the best that it can be without all the pressure . So it ended up working out pretty well for us .","Um , a time , as I said , I was a project manager as my previous experience . So there was a time when we were setting up for , um , an event and there was conf conflict with the amount of , um , members of our team to come in . So we had to make a quick decision whether to go forward , uh , with the event and , or to , uh , cancel the whole thing completely . Um , but we were able to come together with a decision quickly to go forth with the advent and were able to call ahead , um , some reliable employees to come in on short notice and make arrangements for the ones that did not show , um , to , to kind of get armed bearings on where everyone was at the time and , uh , to kind of manage the situation and just organize , uh , where all the team members were standing . So they ended up working out really well for us .","I'm on high pressure event that had happened to me in a work setting was as an activities manager for a , um , retirement home . It can be very stressful thinking , um , on the fly of an activity to do when residents are not wanting to do an activity . So , um , those can be very stressful and you just have to kind of adapt to what their level of activity is . So , um , in the instance we had planned for a , a corn hole tournament , but everyone was very sleepy and tired . Um , the , it was very rainy that day , so it , even the lighting was kind of dimmer than it usually is . So we ended up , um , I ended up coordinating a painting , um , class with them and , um , found some canvases in our activities closet . And so we ended up doing a painting , um , day and I brought out some wine for them that turned out to be a very good outcome and a little wine of wine evening . It was a very , um , successful event . And , um , thinking of fly can be very stressful sometimes , but if it does , then it can work out in your favor .","As , um , person who works full time or who would like to work full time for coming into this workplace . I also am a full time students . So , um , in my previous workplace I had to take off , um , work for a class , um , a class exam , but I already committed to working that weekend for an event that I had , um , plan for the work I was in . Um , and I completely forgot that those two things aligned . So , um , to kind of fizzle out the conflict with that , I asked if it would be okay if we could reschedule the event for the three the day prior to the day of we were taking off there so that way I could still work and take care of the event and then still get my day off for the exam and um , for further notice when a time like that would come , um , where I would need to take off for a school related event or exam or something like that . Um , just to make sure that , um , all activities for work are sorted out , um , pertaining to me . So that way it would never happen again . Cause , um , I would like to keep all that separate so I can continue to work full time and be a full time student .",2.666666667,2,2.5,2.666666667,2.333333333
123,P5539hz-ew64rm,"Whenever I think about a time that I had to adapt to a changing work environment is whenever I was in college and I worked for target . Um , my environment was changing constantly . My work environment was changing and I actually find changes in my work environment to be exciting because I don't really enjoy to do the same thing over and over . So for example , I was tasked with changing the children's section within the fashion department at target , and we needed to quickly make the changes within that department because a lot of stuff was piling up in the back room . And I wanted to be able to make those changes without interrupting any guests that were shopping . So I decided for me and my team to work on this project whenever there weren't guests in the store . I think that the way I handled this situation proves my ability to be able to think creatively and adapt to my changing work environment .","So this question is actually relevant to my current position as a process technician . Whenever I first started in this industry , I didn't have a lot of knowledge in this particular field , and my promotion typically takes about three years , but I had a goal to get it done within a year so that I could qualify for that promotion . So whenever I started trying to reach my goal , I read a bunch of technical books on the processes . I talked to my coworkers , and I set out a detailed schedule for myself so that I would be able to reach this goal that I wanted to obtain within a year . And thanks to all the small goals that I had set along the way and the detailed schedule that I created , I was able to get the promotion within a year and two months rather than the three years that it usually takes .","So the situation that comes to mind is whenever I was a team lead at target , I was responsible for creating the staffing schedule and , um , I was responsible for that and our style department , I had a certain budget that I needed to meet and I also needed to keep in mind about the guest traffic and not to understaff but I didn't have all of the information that I needed . So I had to work with a few different team members and just observe the store on different days of the week to create an estimate of whenever we had the highest traffic times . And I was able to come up with a schedule that matched that data . I used my , um , critical thinking skills and logic in order to fill in the blanks and make this schedule for my team . It ended up working out quite well and I understand our customer traffic flow much better now than I did before .","Whenever I was doing my undergrad , I felt that I was in a high stress , high pressure situation pretty much the whole four years because I was doing my undergrad and I was working a full time job at the same time . And what helps me do with these types of situations is I set out a clear schedule of what I need to do in order of most importance . And I have to follow that schedule very strictly . And I also give time for myself to do the things that I enjoy so that I don't experience burnout in my schedules . I always start with the things that are essential and I don't really think about the less important or the later things until it comes time to think about them .","I think that more often than not , most jobs have a lot of conflicting priorities and you just have to decide what's the most important based on the current job that you have at hand . Um , I think communication between your supervisor and the team members is the most important thing . So whenever I have experienced , uh , conflicting priorities within my job , I made sure to talk to my supervisor and work out which things that were the most important for them so that I could make a list for myself and do the most important and urgent tasks first and then start to worry about the other task . In addition to this , I feel that it's extremely important to communicate with other team members . And maybe if someone was less busy than you weren't , then you could use teamwork to complete all the tasks that need to be done .",4.666666667,3,2.75,3,2
124,P8pmv7h-2zz97h,"Considering the , um , overall changes that have been happening across the world over the last few years in regards to the , uh , coronavirus pandemic . Um , there have been many situations where I , and many others have had to adapt their well , multiple aspects of their employment and their work environment . So for myself specifically , um , as somebody who has been predominantly been teaching over the past years , a lot of that has involved an adaptation of every single one of my day to day practices . Um , I've been teaching online , I've been engaging with , um , not just my students , but also pairs , um , peers , colleagues , uh , parents , um , instead of having that person to person attraction . Um , but with that said , there has still been an era of , um , necessity that I maintain the same relationships and have the same impact that I would be able to do under normal circumstances . Um , essentially how I've done that to just make it as positive as possible is to break it down into smaller steps whenever possible and keep it as organized as I can . So I use a physical journal that I keep broken down by day , time , week , et cetera , as well as , um , a digital Google calendar to make notes of , um , appointments , whether that's , uh , personal , um , or employment related , uh , meetings , phone calls with parents to really make sure that I am , um , doing so at the same frequency that I would normally do . Um , otherwise .","The most recent goal , um , for a project that I've had to set would be the second term report cards , which is quite an intensive project . So this entails , um , for each one of my students going through obviously the actual percentage grade across their subjects that I teach , um , which I believe is four core subjects as well as a couple others , um , such as art , um , computers , business , et cetera . Um , that however is the easier part in addition to the grades for each of those subjects , I have to break down , um , different learning skills and a rating of , um , excellent , very good , good , et cetera . In relation to the , the actual achieved grade . Um , however , the most intensive part is a separate page , which is purely just the commentary , again , broken down by , uh , the core subjects , but as well as like an introduction conclusion . Um , some teachers prefer to simply go by a bank of comments . I like to try to make mine more personalized when possible . Um , of course it's sometimes easier said than done , but in order to do that , I really , really have to plan far in advance . Um , we are normally given what we need , um , to begin working on these , I'd say three weeks ahead of time from when they're due , give or take . Um , however , I try to start ahead of that , um , in any way that I can . Um , so for example , I can already start with the introduction and the conclusion comments for each of my students because , and of course adapt them as necessary if things change . Um , but that results in a much smoother , um , completion . It's always on time . It's always accurate . I have time to double check , triple check , everything , spelling , grammar and whatnot . Um , and it always ends up as a win win situation for myself and my supervisors .","Some of the most important decisions that , um , I deal with on a , at least a semi regular basis would come down to assessment points . Um , as I work for a private school in particular , the , the weight of my job largely falls onto academic results . So there have been , uh , most recently , one particular , um , assessment for our unit of history , um , which they only start in January as opposed to , um , units that have been ongoing since the start of the school year in September . Now my coworkers teaching the same grade level as myself had opted to do their assessment point , um , on a Thursday a few weeks ago . They believe that , that , I guess that was , you know , how it , how it normally would flow . That would be the average , you know , time that that would normally fit into the curriculum . Um , and I was therefore encouraged to do it , um , to keep it , the timing alongside the other classes . However , I , I really strongly didn't feel that my class was ready in the same sense as there is may have been . Perhaps that's on me . Um , or perhaps , you know , they were prioritizing the schedule over , um , the , the success potentially up there , their respective classes . Um , I touched base with a couple of my coworkers that were more neutral , third parties . Um , they weren't teaching the same grade or the same subjects just to get their opinions on the matter , which I felt really , really helped , um , clarify for myself . So what I ended up doing , taking that , um , assistance into consideration was I still did a slight delay . Um , but I ended up doing the assessment on the following Monday , so less than like a week later . But I just felt that they could at least use the weekend to , to get up to where I , I would hope they would be for that point .","As well as , um , being in full time employment . I am also pursuing a master's program , um , a master's of science in psychology and neuroscience of mental health . And though I'm nearing the end of that , uh , part time program , there have been many instances where I have found it extremely stressful . Um , very perhaps part of that is , is what I put on myself . A part of that definitely comes from the prestige of the school and the grading and expectations that come along with that . Um , so I'd say the , the most stressful situation has been , um , certain types of courses that are more focused on what my background previously hasn't been as informed on . So when it comes to the more neuroscientific topics and the , um , corresponding assessment points and grading , I find those much more difficult and I usually know , takes me a lot longer to complete something to a standard that I at least feel is acceptable to submit . Oftentimes it means really starting from the ground zero , you know , breaking down every single concept one at a time that I may or may not understand . Um , and going from there , which Is definitely beneficial in the long run . Um , but feels extremely overwhelming in the given time and circumstance when I'm , I'm expected to be completing something at it , at a somewhat high academic level , but , you know , I am lacking some of that , that core understanding that I need to take upon myself to brush up on .","So when it comes to different , um , commitments or priorities that , um , fall onto my plate at my place of work , there's usually a slight fluctuation in what I may prioritize and given under different circumstances . Um , there would be tasks or commitments that are coming down from my , my direct supervisors like my , my , that the basic job description , what is expected of me . There are things that I , uh , maybe ask to request it up from parents that it's still within reason , part of my job description , but it tends to of course go above and beyond . You know , I'm going out of my way to , to adapt and do what I can , um , depending on , on the request . Um , and then of course there's what , uh , my students may ask of me if they need to , uh , find a time to talk to me if they need to . Um , some extra assistance with something . Um , I'd say most recently a specific situation would be , um , a parent calling and informing me that she would be taking her daughter , um , my student on a longterm trip to India to visit an ailing family member . Unfortunately . Um , however she wanted for approximately leave , it comes out to close to five weeks , um , would still have her learning online . Um , and therefore asked me to essentially put together just a very , very rough , um , day to day schedule because of the time difference that she wouldn't be able to come to the afternoon classes and whatnot . This however , was it the one of the final weeks when I was finishing up report card . So I told her I would absolutely get this to her before she leaves for the trip . Um , but that she would have to give me some time because there was a lot going on otherwise . Um , she messaged me two days later , um , and I had to basically tell her a little bit more firmly that I have not forgotten . I will do this , but that is not my priority at the moment . Um , I ended up waiting longer than I would have liked to get this information back to the mother . Um , but I did do it within technically the timeframe that I had described . However , it was tricky because I knew that their report cards without a doubt had to be my ultimate priority .",3.333333333,3.75,3.333333333,2,3.333333333
125,Ptcdxuj-63jbgv,"Working in the schools , things are always complex and , uh , changing and moving and , uh , everything happens at a very fast pace because , you know , you have a thousand students who , um , are all , we're working on really hard things all at the same time . So definitely one of the , uh , biggest steps to this is creating partnership and teams and understanding the personalities of all the different players . What are their roles , what are they best at , um , and understanding how you fit into that dynamic and how you can best work with different people to , uh , you know , respond to information as it comes in or respond to fast moving situations , um , as they occur . Or how can you triage , how can you work with , uh , different people ? How can you delineate roles and break things up and divide and conquer ? Um , that definitely , uh , just creates the best teamworking environment to make sure that everything is being handled , everything gets handled , um , and it's handled in the most efficient way possible with as little downtime . So definitely having that teamwork and social skills and knowing everyone's role is very important to adapting to , um , to problems that come , that arise and complex fast paced working environments .","I have a lot of goals , uh , to increase tier one interventions , um , in the schools . And the way that I do that is by , um , just using the best of my consultative skills to try to understand where other people are coming from and understand , um , what they feel they need from me to help me achieve that goal . So I'm , I'm really proactive in setting up meetings , talking about what all of the players are thinking , um , giving them confidence where they need it , and then also offering assistance , um , where they need it . Because when I have people who are supporting me and are supporting my goals and objectives , um , I'm able to , um , make sure that I'm reaching them and I'm able to make sure that , um , I have the support that I need , um , and to , to have everyone involved in a really complex situation . So using the full extent of my consultative skills , um , is really how I make sure that I get , lay the foundation for , um , for reaching goals and making sure that everyone's on the same page in progressively reaching them .","When we are faced with crisis situations in the schools , we have to act fast and we need to make sure that we are making the best decisions possible for our kids . But we have sometimes , you know , the three different agencies , you know , um , it giving us information , we have information from the kids , schools , parents , home , all of those places . Um , so everyday we make quick decisions about , um , where you know , what , what the outcome is going to be when we're in a crisis situation and what's going to be , um , the safest and most beneficial for everyone . Um , even when you feel like there needs to be a quick decision , probably the most important thing is to slow down and not make any rash decisions . Make sure that you speak to everyone that you do know all of the information you have , all the information and that you're not just saying , yeah , okay . And not quite understanding , you know , ask for clarification . Um , and make sure that you have everything and you have it right in order to , um , to fully have the best , um , outcome and playing out those , those different outcomes too . So figuring out , you know , what's sort of the pros and cons of this and making sure that you're taking in information from the team , from experts , and uh , just making sure that you have everything altogether . You slow down and then you actually make the best decision , you know , for , um , everyone involved with all of the information . Um , and you haven't just made it out of , you know , uh , you haven't made it , you know , in a rash way . You've thought through everything . And even though if you felt pressured , you took that time to think it through , take some time away and make decision that was best with all of the information .","Whenever I'm speaking to a client and I feel like it's , um , they're very heightened or it's going to be a stressful or , um , just high pressure situation . Um , I try to take a step back and figure out where that heightened emotionality is coming from . And usually it's coming from fear , confusion . So , um , I really try to take that step back personally , connect with the person and be straightforward , honest , and help them understand , um , the situation , the procedures , what's going on so that they feel more confident in me and they feel more empowered to have information about , um , what's going on . Um , and usually taking that step back , personally , connecting and trying to allay those fears and acknowledge that it's a stressful situation , but , you know , getting them on your side , um , helps to sort of bring down the level of , um , of , of stress or the level of pressure and that situation and just say , Hey , let's have a conversation about this . You know , um , you know , I want what's best for it , for both of us . You know , we're both on the same side . So how can we , um , how can we work together to accomplish what our goals are and then staying on track to what those are and not letting it DVA into other things that , um , could just bring in extra stress or pressure to the situations . You know , now we have a goal in this conversation or in this situation , um , and we want to stay on track to , um , to completing that goal , um , with as much confidence as possible .","I have a lot of different responsibilities at my current job . And , um , sometimes things have to take priority . Things come up that , um , need to be dealt with immediately can not be put off . Um , and sometimes those things arise suddenly when you could have a meeting that has been scheduled for weeks , you know , if not months . Um , and they happens quite often . So , um , in the event that I can't get a , a colleague or someone else to sort of triage into that situation , um , I think the best app is as soon as I know that there's going to be a conflict , communicating it to the people . Um , so it's not like , Oh , I'm going to try to see if I could get there . And then five minutes before I'd be like , sorry , I can't , you know , it's giving them as much notice as possible that , you know , Hey , as soon as I know I'm dealing with the situation , I might not be able to get into that meeting , provide , um , anyone that I can , any proxy with as much information as I possibly can so that they can feel , um , like they can , uh , go in , in my place where they can , um , provide as much information . And then , uh , really the only thing that you can do in that situation , um , when you know , you , you have to rearrange priorities or anything like that , um , is to provide as much as Torrance to people , um , as possible that you will , um , take every action needed , um , at a later date to , uh , get the information that's needed to , um , to take any actions that are needed to answer any questions that weren't able to be answered and to personally connect with , um , any people who might have been affected by , um , by your absence . Um , but again , it's just you plan for it as much as possible and then just be flexible when , um , when those things come up , you know , you can't be too worried about it . You can't be trying to , you know , do two things , um , and not do either of them . Well , it's , you know , you prioritize in that time and then you do damage control after the fact , and you give people as much warning as possible and as much information as possible .

126,Papx25r-bcbepq,"So as a project manager , I have worked in the tech industry and the private sector mostly , but I've also done a bit of public sector as well . Um , but we're always facing or I'm always facing , um , a lot of changing environments , a lot of changing deadlines , different customer or client , uh , desired results . So you really have to be quite agile when dealing , um , in this type of environment . So , um , an example of a complex , excuse me , a complex environment at work . I was actually working on a project , uh , with the private sector , a tech company . Um , they had some requirements for a , um , a project , a program that we were working on delivering to them . Um , I was Manning , managing a team of , uh , 12 developers , a business analyst , um , as well as some it support . Um , the client decided that they wanted some last minute changes done . Um , we were on a very strict timeline and we were almost , um , you know , we were already halfway through our budget and we only had about another two months to deliver this project . Um , but they had decided that they needed something different . Um , customized in the platform that we were creating for them . So , um , you know , I really had to work well , communicate with my team to make sure that they understand , understood these new requirements . Um , also made it very clear to , uh , communicating expectations , deadlines and everything with the client to make sure that we were all on the same page . Um , you know , understanding timelines and what that's going to look like and what work is going to look like moving forward . Um , luckily I have a very agile team . They're very adaptable . Um , you know , I was able to delegate work , um , clearly to everyone . We all kind of pulled together , uh , you know , and I kept people motivated , um , you know , to understand these requirements , uh , to just come together and uh , and get the work done . So , uh , you know , the steps that I took is just very important to keep communication on my side with my team as well as the client to set expectations , um , as well as to keep the team motivated . You know , I'm not the type to ask , um , my team to do extra work , especially when it's last minute . Um , so it's not something I ask of them all the time , but they always know that I'm willing to step in and help out , um , and get my hands dirty , so to speak . Um , if requirements do change .","While I was working for my previous organization in the public sector , I was in charge of , um , making changes to be protocols in response to coven , uh , response to the pandemic . Um , so of course this was a project that had very strict timelines . You know , we had to react very quickly to changing priorities . Um , you know , we had to work or I had to work very quickly with my team to make sure that , um , all of the steps and protocols were , uh , done in accordance to our policy in accordance to , uh , what was required for the project . Um , so this is where communication always super important . I had to make sure that my team , um , the individuals in my team knew exactly what they were responsible for doing . This was something new for all of us . We had to change gears , uh , from a different project that we were working on and switch to this one due to the high demands of course with . Um , and this was to do with , with benefits , um , for , uh , Canadians . So , um , it was a very important project . Um , but like I said , making sure that , um , everything was communicated well . I had to deal with other managers to make sure I understood the components of the project , exactly what they needed done in order to communicate that well , uh , to my team to make sure that they understood , um , make sure that each individual person knew exactly what they had to do . Um , I essentially just made sure that I was on top of delegating everything , uh , stayed on top of my team , make sure that everything , you know , we were hitting deadlines , um , making sure that if people had questions or problems with their work that I was available to answer those . Um , as well as doing any troubleshooting . Uh , the result was , you know , luckily enough we were able to complete the project on time . Um , you know , it was very complicated . We did have to work some overtime . Um , but of course this was a project that really had to be done . Um , communication went very smoothly . We had no trouble getting in touch with the other , uh , managers on the other end . Um , you know , understanding the expectations and exactly what needed to be done . So , you know , team was very happy . Uh , everything was managed very well , and we had a successful launch of the , um , of the project .","Okay . Uh , when the pandemic , um , first began in March 20 , 20 , um , my organization was faced with having to go completely digital . So prior to , uh , the pandemic and lockdowns we were in person . Um , you know , we conducted our business in person . Um , so we had to make a quick change to adapt very quickly , uh , to moving things online . Um , so with this we had to change a lot of our , um , it systems and , um , our specifically our talent management system , this is where I kept track of all of the , um , different , uh , staff that reported to me as well as their work . Uh , anyways , so we would do most of this in person . So we had to your , I had to , um , find a , a CSS , a talent management system or a consultant service system , um , that would fit all of our needs so that we could successfully move everyone digitally . Um , you know , also had to send out , um , tech for everyone to be able to bring it home . Luckily most people had laptops , but I had to make sure that everyone had all of the equipment that they needed at home to do their job . Um , as well as looking at any protocols , um , to make sure that we were compliant with , um , you know , legislation and covered procedures for the province . Um , The conflicting information that I had , unfortunately I had different sources who were getting back to me , um , and within the organization based on what exactly they thought that we needed for the STEM talent management system , what we needed to purchase or have integrated and created for us to make a customized application that all of our consultants and all of my , uh , team , uh , all the people that are I'm responsible for would have access to . And , uh , to do that . You know , we did a survey , we did lots of , um , outreach to just see what people needed to have access to from home to make sure that we covered all basis . Um , however , there was different opinions or differences in opinions on what was actually needed for the system to have . And because we had to make a quick a decision very quickly or I had to make a decision very quickly . Um , it , it was a little bit difficult . Uh , I tried to take as much information in as possible , uh , but at the end of the day , you know , I had to use my best judgment . Um , and the final decision we also had to look at cost as well . Um , cause it was unexpected . So , um , you know , I just had to take all information into consideration and do my best to work with , um , the team to get everything that they needed in order to do their work successfully . Um , remotely .","Presently , I am working for a project with the federal government . I have a team of eight people . Um , we are working on a project that is highly technical and requires a lot of specialized talent to be able to , um , you successfully complete the work . Um , it is quite a stressful situation . As I said . Uh , finding talent for these highly , um , skilled and specific roles can be quite challenging . Um , and part of that is my job to ensure that I have the people with the right skills in order to make sure that our project is delivered on time , um , and that everything is completed according to according to schedule , but according to budget . Um , and I can't allow for any , um , delays in delivering this . So there's a lot of pressure on me . Uh , very stressful . I had a gentleman who was a specialized , uh , developer that we needed . He had a very specialized skillset , um , in particular , uh , working with a technology that the federal government had used , um , about eight years ago . So it was a little outdated and it was very difficult to find people with the skillset . Um , and unfortunately this gentleman was working for me . Um , but something had come up in his private life . Uh , so unfortunately he had to leave this position , pardon me , about four months early . So there was a lot of pressure on me in order to find someone to replace him . Um , you know , it was very challenging . There's not that many people in the market that actually have this skill set and typically if they do have it , they're already working . Um , so it really involved a lot , uh , research on my end . I had to partner with different , uh , HR consulting agencies in order to find somebody with a specialized skillset , um , because we also had a very strict timeline . Um , and we were kind of holding the team back a little bit because we needed somebody in this role . We are waiting on those tasks to be completed so that other people would take on the workload . Um , so I , uh , I really try to utilize my network . I asked a lot of different colleagues and friends if they knew anyone . And like I said , I partnered with an HR consulting company . Uh , luckily they were able to help me out to find somebody for this role . And , uh , I got somebody in that role within two weeks , so we didn't lose too much work . Um , and , uh , you know , our timeline got back on track . He didn't need much help . Uh , as a professional consultant . He was able to start , um , with the team and everything went on smoothly . And , uh , luckily , um , we just finished that project , uh , three weeks ago , a very successful , uh , everything was launched beautifully and , uh , management was happy . Um , you know , I was a little stressed there at the end , but , uh , everything worked out just fine .","This question is very interesting . Um , usually if I keep a commitment , I really like to , um , to maintain it . Um , but I also have , um , this ability where I'm not , I wouldn't say an ability , but I really love to help if people need my help . If someone reaches out to me , I want to be able to help them because I want to see them be successful . Uh , and that's what makes me happy . Uh , so sometimes I have a hard time saying no . For this particular situation I had made a commitment to a more junior project manager on my team . They had just been in the field for about a year . They were very junior . They did have their PMP and they were just getting started . Uh , they were new to our team , so they were a bit unfamiliar with our procedures and protocols , protocols and how things worked in the environment . Um , so I decided to mentor them . Um , we had been working together for about three months , um , where at this time , uh , you know , things were working quite well . I was helping him with all of his questions . Um , and you know , any concerns or problems that would arise , I would be that go to person for him . Um , but unfortunately , um , this was during your , uh , year end , last year , fiscal year end and things aren't quite busy . I had a lot of dead deadlines , um , and I wasn't able to give him as much attention as I wanted to . Um , and unfortunately I wasn't able to make , um , all of our meetings every week , things got pushed back . Um , which was too bad cause I really wanted to commit to him and he was doing very well , very successful . And it was really nice for us to work together cause he would also give me ideas that would help me out too . Um , so it was great to brainstorm with him . Um , but yes , unfortunately due to lots of different deadlines I had for year end , I had to move our , um , our meetings instead of meeting weekly , we met more on a monthly basis . Um , unfortunately there were two months that I wasn't able to meet with him . Um , so that was a commitment that I did have to break . Uh , which , you know , I didn't love , but unfortunately , if I do have a deadline , if I have work that needs to be done , that's definitely a priority . And I explained that very well to my mentee and thankfully he understood . Um , he even helped me to complete some things , um , which was very helpful . Um , so really good relationship . I'm happy I did that . Um , and now , uh , I'll continue to work with him . Uh , now that all of that , um , the busy time is , is complete .",3.666666667,3.5,3.666666667,3,2.666666667
127,P5vauqf-5x7jf2,"One time where there was , um , a really bad situation at work . There was a lot of phone calls coming in and a lot of clients coming in at the door . And at the same time there was a new employee that was hired that I was also training . So in this complex situation where I have phones going off and I'm supposed to answer , we call plus clients and plus the person beside me who's not really trained to do anything . So the sole responsibility is on me . So I feel like I tackled that situation very well by prioritizing the order in which I first handle the calls , put them on hold and then deal with the clients one by one and asking my train trainee , coworker to handle the customers that had the simple request . And I felt like that relieved the stress for everyone . And it also allowed , um , the clients to feel less angry and feel like they were being attended to more . And I feel like , uh , as a project manager , patients is a really highly beneficial quality because you have to deal with so many things and so many tasks in the job that if you cannot balance a complex situation , then , um , you probably won't go very far in the role .","One project that we were working on , I wouldn't know if you could call it entirely a project , but , um , previously the coworkers that had been there before but have left the job , left quite a bit of a , um , I would say a little mess for us to correct . So it was a bunch of accounting work that had to be done , which included , um , cash outs that weren't pollens and like payments that needed to be corrected and needed to be searched for and needed to be renewed as well . So almost at least a few weeks worth of invoices were given to us to be corrected somehow . And I evenly distributed the work to each of my coworkers who worked on it at the same pace . And we also asked each other questions when we had problems as well . And we went through them day by day and slowly we got into the rhythm where we were correcting and lease days of areas at a time at a very efficient pace . And I feel like by delegating those jobs , we achieved our goal and had a much stable work outcome as a result . And our , um , accounting balances and cash outs in the future had no errors that were found in the previous weeks with multiple errors . So I say that as a great plan for the past and for the future . So .","One time where I didn't make a decision quickly was when my coworker told me , actually not one , but two of my coworkers that were working the same shift as me that day both told me that they were going to be coming in sick . So at that point , um , even though we are on the same level , like no one was superior in our position , it was my responsibility to find someone who could at least help cover their shifts or help me while I was doing my job to coordinate with clients , handle incoming calls , and also respond to emails . That was a big um , hassle because we needed the people there . We needed help . However , I asked some of the other staff members , I'm like , hello , would you be able to come and help release a little bit , 30 minutes or an hour when it gets really wound up and really busy . And I found people who would do that and were willing to help out for those few hours . And I feel like I handled it really well because with simple calls and simple client requests , um , my other coworkers were able to help them really well . It didn't get too hectic , lines weren't holding up as much , and I feel like my ability to find people to be able to help in such a short time shows that I can be a pretty reliable worker and the other coworkers also seeing me as someone they're willing to help out , which I believe shows how we have great teamwork as well .","Time there was immediate project I had to do in the first year of university and I don't like to do public speaking is one of the things that I would not ever do if I didn't have to , especially in front of a lot of people . And in this particular project it was encouraged of other people to ask questions and ask , um , voice any concerns they may have because it was a part of our grade . So I , that is another thing I don't really like as much because , um , presentations already make me very nervous and I feel like I can do them well , but it's just not my favorite thing to do . So in that certain situation , which may not be as stressful for others , that can be very stressful for me to perform . And I began to stutter and also began to , um , stumble on my words a little . So I practice and practice and practice at home maybe about 15 , 20 times each day for a week before my presentation to make sure that I could go as smoothly as it could . But even when I came the day of the presentation , um , one of my classmates who were just very , very smart , asked me a very complex question and I was not sure if I was able to answer that correctly . So I thought better from Ben lie . So I told him , to be honest , I'm not too sure . I can try and research and find out if you'd like to know for the next class . And I think that was a pretty good response now that I think prior to it , back at that time , I was really embarrassed that I didn't know the answer , but I realized sometimes , you know , you can't know the answer for everything and that's okay too .","One of the situations would be when I had a family reunion to attend to . However , I was the same time one of my coworkers called in sick and no one was there to cover my shift . So I feel like as would probably the project manager role , I needed to make a sacrifice because it's not like I can leave the work unattended to even if I had paid days off . Um , it was something that I feel like it was my responsibility because even though my coworker probably didn't intend to be sick , I still needed to find someone to cover my shift . So instead of leaving at the time that I was supposed to be leaving , I stayed a couple hours later , did as much work as I could prior to my other Corps coming in for their shift and try to make things easier for them to come in because they weren't trained for my position . And I feel like I stayed a couple hours later and doing as much work as I can before the other person comes in is a really good thing because it lessens the stress on them and still gives me enough time to attend the reunion , even though I was a little bit late .",3,2.5,3,3.333333333,3
128,Pqtquem-aqha6e,"In my last position as director of marketing before I was actually promoted to that position , we had actually a few organizational changes where um , a lot of staff were leaving . We were hiring a lot of new staff and the current director of marketing at the time was , was still there and she as far as I knew , wasn't planning on going anywhere . Um , and but w she decided to leave and it was totally amicable , but it was pretty sudden . And it was a short time later that they decided that I was the best fit to now move into this role , which was fantastic for me because it was a new position in a higher position . Um , but obviously a huge change for me too because it's taking on a lot more work . And of course I'm now responsible for managing a team of people , whereas I was on said team of people before . Again , obviously a huge change , me getting in the new role plus a ton of other people coming in and out . So once I moved into this role , I ended up having new people that I hadn't really even talked to before because they were new hires that I had to manage . So I had to then , uh , you know , grow those relationships pretty quickly , um , and make sure that I was creating a team that was going to be able to , uh , produce really great work in a , in a short time because they were picking up , you know , where other people left off and they were brand new . So they had to learn the organization . They had to learn the brands we were working with , cause it was an agency . Um , the steps I took were , you know , upping my , my leadership skills , really , um , working on improving my leadership skills and also I'm a great communicator overall , but also improving my sort of , um , interpersonal communication skills as it pertains to being someone's manager . And at , uh , after maybe only a month or two , um , myself and the new team were really into the groove of things and we're already knocking out great , fantastic work out of the park .","When you work with a client base , it can be really tough to achieve timeline goals because you're relying on your client to get back to you with the information that you need . In order to complete a project . I set feedback , goals , feedback , timeline goals for every client that I deal with to say , you know , we've completed this part of our project . I'm going to need your feedback by this day . For us to be able to move forward with the project . One specific project for that tactic wasn't really working because my client actually wasn't meeting their timeline goals . Um , it was impacting my team in , in being able to meet their own timeline goals and eventually the steps that we took for that were to , um , create not a new schedule overall . But I , I created an adjusted schedule that I then presented to my client and I had my team , uh , work on other projects because it wasn't their fault and it wasn't my fault that we didn't have the feedback that we needed to move forward . So I set up a new timeline schedule connected with my client and said , does this feel like it's working for you ? Before I was giving you three days for feedback , maybe you need five , maybe you need six . How can we make this work ? How can we extend the schedule so that you are able to provide clear , concise and good feedback that we need every step of the way and not feel like you're being left out of the process . Because that's a big problem with clients . You never want them to feel like they're not involved , especially when it comes to communications projects . Um , so after I had that conversation with them , we reworked our schedule where we were , we worked our timeline , we did end up extending it some . They did have the ability to stand the end point of the project and we gave them a few extra days . So we went from , you have three days , give me feedback to you have five days that you beat you back . And that's where the extension of the project came from too . So that they could have those extra days in between in order to get back to us so we could move forward with , with their work .","I'm actually working on a project right now where , um , the person that I had been in most closely working with and who was providing me most of the information that I needed , uh , left the organization mid project . So I ended up having to a figure out if , if we're moving this forward now that that person is not with us anymore and B , if we are moving it forward , there's a lot more information that I need . And is is the information that he gave me even correct . And it turns out it wasn't fully correct at all . Um , but I did have a deadline to get this work done and it was a printing job and I , and yeah , so I had only so much time to get it done and the information my previous coworker had given to me wasn't actually correct as far as I could tell based on what I was getting from a new coworker . So what I ended up actually doing was going to my finance people to say , okay , who was the company that took care of situation ? A , because I need to go right to the source right now to find out if , what information I need in order to push this forward . And that's what I did . So I , my finance department , because they would've handled the transaction with the outside organization that I needed the information from . So they would have known who that outside organization was . Nobody else knew except for the person who had left the organ organization already . So I couldn't ask him . Uh , so yeah , I got my finance department around that . They got me the contact and I was able to reach out to them and have it all wrapped up in a neat little boat by my deadline .","Yeah . When I was in university , I was doing a group project , which nobody likes a group project as we all know . And one member of my group just wasn't pulling their weight . And when I say I just wasn't pulling the right , I mean they weren't even coming to the group meetings , let alone participating in the actual work . And at some point myself and my other group members got together and said , okay , are we just going to allow this other person to get the same grade as us for for the work that we did or do we want to do something about it ? And it might not sound so stressful , but it became stressful for me because they decided that I would be the best person to address the situation . They want it to be brought to the professor and to see what we should do . And yeah , they thought that I was the best person to do that . So I mean , I was still in my early twenties maybe only 21 . Um , confrontation is still not my strong suit , but I did go to my professor . I explained the situation to him . I said , you know , I didn't have any qualms with the other group member . It just didn't make sense to allow that person to continue as a member of our group if they aren't contributing any of the work . And he completely understood and he gave that group member an individual assignment to complete on their own . And yeah , it ended up working out .","A few months back , there was a networking event in my city . Uh , it was industry based on the industry that I'm in and my organization wanted someone to go to network on our behalf and I was happy to do that . And I know I was actually really excited to attend the event . Um , it was an outside of work event , but I was fine with that . Um , as long as we had someone there from our organization to represent us , that was good . Unfortunately , shortly before the event I got called to do a separate presentation , which was specific to a work project and would unfortunately have to Trump going to a networking event While I was super disappointed and I had already signed up for the networking event and uh , pay for it and things like that . And I was really looking forward to attending . Um , I had to see who I thought would be the next best , I guess , person in the organization to take that on because not everyone in Joe , I'm the comms person , so obviously I don't mind speaking with people and doing things like that , but in a company full of engineers where I work , they don't love doing that stuff . Um , but I was lucky enough to get one such engineer who actually is a very outgoing and great guy and asked him if he would mind doing an after work networking event on behalf of the company cause I was unable to make it due to these other work priorities . And he happily obliged . I just switched my registration to him and it all worked out in the end .",4,3.75,3,2.333333333,3.333333333
129,Pj4wryf-dnuiga,"So I haven't been in a position for the senior network engineer for about seven to eight years . And recently in the last two years , our positions were changed because of a merger that happened between our companies . And now I have been working on totally different , uh , technologies right now . I used to be a network engineer and I used to work on routers and firewalls , but now my job role has just shifted . Totally . And by a coincidence , what happened now is that I am working on vendors and I have been working on technologies that are totally different than what I was used to . So now , and I am now in an even advanced role than what I used to be . So all the seven years that I had been doing work is totally irrelevant now . So now , since the last two years I have been working on load balances and new firewalls and that's a totally different learning curve . And the whole architecture and the design of the network is different . So before I used to be a technical project manager kind of role , now I kind of lead the deep dives and Mmm . The complexity is on a whole different level because now I'm like a tier three support . And before I used to be deployment . So it's totally changed work . Totally complex environment because of the unfamiliarity with the vendors and the platforms . But I'm , I'm fixed . I have been successful for the last two years . I've been working my way through it . I have learned a lot and I'm willing to learn more and hopefully in the next year or so I'll even get better . So I , this shows that I , I'm , I'm not hesitant to learn a totally new platform where I don't know anything , but the expectations are high . So I would be created for this project management position .","So in my role as a technical project manager , I always had deadlines to meet and I had a whole project scope in front of me and it had some set timelines that I had to meet and I never in my seven years was not able to meet those guidelines and the timelines . Um , I have always met those times and I've even been able to complete the work ahead of time . I would say most , I would say 80% of the time I was able to successfully complete them ahead of time and the other 20% , I was able to make it , make the project done in time . Um , the project management included setting up contacts for the nighttime work maintenance window work . It included managing the project during the day , lining up contacts and lining up testers and lining up , um , all the people that needed to be there for the project to be successful . And I have done that work for almost seven years now and I have had a pretty successful career for that .","So part of my job also involved nighttime walk where I had to be the daytime project lead in the in the day and then at night there were some times where I had to actually implement those changes at night when there was a lot of work during the night and people couldn't get to it . My night team couldn't do the work because of the heavy workload , so I had to jump at night to help them up . So multiple times at night when we were doing a deployment , we had situations where something went South and something went wrong and we had to make a decision and on the fly , and there's been multiple times I can remember where I had to make a split second decision and I was under stress . I knew that there would be questions if something goes wrong , but then I was confident in my abilities and I covered all the bases before I made a decision and then we deployed the changes that I made on the fly . I have never had a problem with that because I made sure that I was at least 90 95% sure of what I was doing , and I knew what I was doing . So I'm pretty confident that anytime such a situation arises , I don't know how to handle it and I would be able to be successful in it .","So I remember in the initial years when I started working , uh , for the , for my comp for the company I worked with , um , there was a time where I wasn't very familiar with the platform . And , um , by mistake , I cleared a firewall session table during the day , which resulted in about 500,000 connections being wiped out on the firewall . And those connections have to be reattempted . Um , I think , um , I could have lied my way through it , but then I was pretty honest with what I did . I was very open and I admitted my fault because , um , that is what I should have done , I think . And , um , and I told my manager what happened and I explained everything to him and he was pretty good and he was pretty , um , happy about me reaching out to him . And then he , I had the confidence in him and then he backed me all the way . I'm talking to different teams and it wasn't a big outage , but still it showed him that I was , uh , even under stress . I did not , um , lie or I did not lie , like , um , perform some . Um , I wouldn't say legal , but , um , I did not do anything wrong that I shouldn't be doing morally in that time of stress . And even at night , at a couple of times , there were things that I , um , I could have heard from people , but I admitted to it and I , I believe in admitting to fault because we all are humans and humans are , the humans always make for you . Nobody . Nobody's perfect . So I think doing the right thing is important under stress or in any situation . So , uh , that is what I believe in .","As part of my previous job and even in this job is the job role is such that I have to do multiple things at once . There's multiple projects going on at once and um , there's multiple , a whole list of things that I'm doing at once . So sometimes what happens is one thing takes priority over another . And even though I tried to work my way through all of them and may try to keep everybody afloat on what is going on and keep them updated , there's times when something takes a higher priority and something gets missed . And the person whose work depends on my work , um , starts complaining or starts inquiring about where we are with that project . So , um , I usually become , be very honest and I have a good relation with my manager . So I explain everything to my manager ahead of time . And then I let the , that person first talk to me and if he's not satisfied , I let him talk to my manager and then I let the manager decide what needs to take priority . And then if my manager tells me that , um , the less priority thing needs to get done , I would explain it to him again . And if he doesn't , he wants that thing to be done , then I usually just listen to him and get whatever things needs to be done . Um , they haven't been times , uh , in the past where I had to work extra hours to get everything done , and I don't mind doing that . But , um , I do believe in a healthy work life balance , especially working from home . So once in a while is fine , but I don't like to make it a routine where I'm working extra hours and it , I have to sacrifice my family time . So thank you .",3.333333333,3.333333333,2.666666667,3,2.666666667
130,P7tw5bq-7hw3pb,"About a year into my current position . Uh , there were a lot of organizational changes in my department . The department lead changed . Um , most of my team changed . I was one of the only ones that stayed . And so there were a lot of changes going on and I had to really adapt to that new environment . I had to get used to working with new people . I had to get used to new expectations and , um , a new manager . And so the number one thing that was important for me at that time was to really communicate , um , especially with my new manager , I needed to make sure that he knew what was going on with my projects . That , um , you know , I communicated with people in different parts of the organization that I needed to work with just to make sure that everyone was always on the same page because , um , there are a lot of things that when you're used to working in a specific system , uh , that you just take for granted and everyone knows how things work . But when you , when things get shaken up like that , you really have to , you can't make assumptions . You need to make sure that communication is clear and that , uh , everyone is always on the same page as to what needs to happen , when it needs to happen and who is going to get it done .","A few months ago , I worked on a project to , uh , replace a set of pumps in our facility . And , uh , there was a us , a firm deadline that we needed to meet , uh , because there was a small window of time where we could actually replace those pumps . And so all of the planning and coordination and , and budgeting and purchasing had to happen , you know , it , it's specific times so that we could make this deadline and be able to finish the project in this , this small window of time . And so , um , I started out , I made sure to have , um , plenty of meetings , get the right people involved in the team , make sure that we had regular followup meetings so that everyone stayed on track and that we wouldn't get behind . I made sure that we , uh , got the right permitting and approvals going as soon as possible and , and really look at the whole project and figure out , okay , what do we need to do and when do we need to do it in order to meet this deadline ?","I recently faced a situation at work in which we were having real , real problems with one of our pieces of equipment and , um , we weren't sure what was going on , but it was preventing , um , preventing production , our facility . And so , um , what I had to do was , was get everyone together and kind of get everyone's opinions on the table because operations had one opinion as to what the problem was , maintenance at another opinion . And , and we had contractors come in and they had a different opinion . So , um , every time you talked to someone , you ended up having a different conversation and you kind of just ended up going in a circle . But , uh , when you got everyone together to really talk about what was going on , we were able to kind of eliminate things that we knew weren't happening and eventually get down to the root cause .","I worked on one project , um , where we had a deadline for installation . And unfortunately , we missed the deadline because one of the parts got delayed . And a few days later we had a , um , a member of the senior management team who came and visited our site . And , um , they , they wanted an update on this project . They wanted to know what was going on and , and it was , uh , it seemed at the time , to me , very high stakes because I knew that , you know , we hadn't met the deadline for this project , but , uh , the nurse most important thing was just that I was honest and straight forward and explain what happened and , and in hindsight would have , could have been done to prevent it . But , you know , at that point I explained what , what our options were and how we were moving forward to , to make the most of the situation .","I was asked to join a sustainability committee at work and I was excited .

Um , but shortly after that , um , we had a couple people leave our team and so I had all of a sudden a lot more responsibility , our facility and I was covering a lot more areas than I typically would . And so I had to assume a bunch of projects , um , that I hadn't been working on before and my time was just really limited . And so I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to follow through with my commitment to this sustainability committee . But , um , I talked to the committee chair and explain what was going on and explained that I still wanted to be involved in this committee , but that , you know , there might be times when I would have to miss a meeting or something . And , and I just asked them to be understanding and , and help me to , to keep up with things .

131,P9t5ca7-btcq3e,"Hi , first of all , I just like to start by saying thank you so much for interviewing me . I am very excited about the opportunity to talk to you about the project management job and um , again , just thank you for the opportunity . Um , I would love to be a project manager . Um , I have some 25 years of experience in teaching and I'm with Cove 19 . I definitely had to um , adapt to a huge change , um , with my work environment . Um , I do teach elementary school and during the time of coven 19 , we went virtual , which um , I'm sure you know what that means but it , um , but if you don't it means that instead of having face to face instruction with my students , we ended up having um , um , virtual meetings and virtual , um , classes . Um , this was extremely hard . Um , at first , however , I was able to pivot and I was able to learn a great deal , um , with um , Google meet and I was able to use , um , Google slideshows and a program called pear deck , which allowed the students to be interactive with me instead of just me talking at them . And them talking back . Um , so that was awesome . I enjoyed the techno technological part of it . Um , as well as , um , being able to have the flexibility to work from home during a time when my children were home . And it was a very scary time actually . Um , so it was nice to be able to be at home and also do my job . Um , the outcome of learning to go virtual was awesome . Um , my students learned , I learned . And , um , it was just great to be able to , um , learn something new , um , with technology and to be able to be successful .","So for my job as a gifted and talented educator in the elementary school , every year we have an enrichment fair , which is a ton of work , um , during this time and during the year , we start off in September and the fair is in may . So there's a lot of work that needs to be done in order to make this enrichment fair of success for not only myself , but my students and the grownups and the public that come see the work of the students . So basically , um , during the year we have different classes that I teach . I teach two sections of math , um , and I teach also some other content related classes where we do really cool science experiments and social studies lessons . And , um , during those times while I'm teaching them , we end up having a end of the year project that actually gets put on display during that enrichment fair in , uh , towards the end of the school year . So , um , it's a lot of work because it's sort of like you can't do things all at once . You have to sort of wait until you teach the students and wait until they produce the work in order to be able to decide , um , which , um , children you'd like to , um , enhance and which students that you'd like to celebrate and which , um , pieces of work you'd like to put on display . So it's not like something that I can say it's in September . Okay , I'm going to work on this all October and then I'll be done for may because all of the work gets done during the entire year . Um , so it is sometimes hard to achieve just knowing right away how much it involves . Um , but like I always say , you know , slow and steady wins the race . I always am organized with a checklist of things that I need to do and the date that I need to have it done . And , um , the result of the , uh , uh , past enrichment fairs or schoolwide showcases that I have been in charge of have been wonderful . Um , I've also elicited , um , help from , from , um , some , some people that work under me just because I feel like delegating tasks is also , um , something that , um , good leaders need to possess . So , um , those , those people that I work with were able to , um , help along the way . And , um , again , just a group effort is , um , something that , um , was really helpful as well .","So yes , I have had a time when I have needed to make a decision , um , quickly . Um , and I was faced with some conflicting information . However , with years of experience that I've had , um , working , I was able to , um , come up with a decision , um , quickly . So there are times when I select students to work with in the gifted and talented program and there are times when we need as a group in order to select those students that , um , that should be invited to participate . Um , sometimes we can't get these meetings and in earlier because certain teachers are very busy . So there was a time when , um , I was about to pull it up , pull a group of students for a brand new month long class and we had to quickly decide which students to choose . So , um , while we were meeting very quickly , like right before I had to start the class , um , there was a girl named Mariah that , um , was a student that was very interested in the content that I was being , that I was about to teach . It was a unit on colonial cultures . And , um , her teacher was very much for putting her in the class . However , his colleague had mentioned that her behavior and her attitude were not the best and she should not be allowed to join my , my class . Cause sometimes the kids think that my classes are special because we do some really cool things in there . Um , however , I did not want , um , a behavior problem or maybe an attitude issue to come between this little girl being able to participate if she had the brains to do it . So I quickly just said , look , I'm going to make the decision . I hear what you're saying to my one colleague . I hear what you're saying to my other colleague . And I quickly made the decision to include her in the class and I am very , very happy that I did . Um , she thrived and , um , she loved the opportunity and it was , um , really great to watch her , um , working and , um , to do , to do a fabulous job . Actually .","Yeah . So in my role as a gifted and talented resource teacher , um , I am also in charge of a lot of paperwork and a lot of work on the computer . So , um , and also along with the work that I do , there's a lot of time crunch involved . So , um , when students take certain standardized tests , they take the test , which I monitor and enjoy and , and am in charge of and the scores come back and then it's a very , very quick turnaround where I need to , um , let those parents know and the administrators know how these children did in a report . So , um , that is very stressful . Um , however I do feel like I am a very calm and patient person and again , I do have years of experience , so I am used to , um , high stressful situations . But , um , what I do is I just , um , make a checklist and make sure that I have all the things that I need to do . And then one at a time I just cross it , the items off , um , as I have , as I have completed them . Um , again , I do feel like I , because of my experiences in my job now , I feel like I had been in several stressful situations and I am able to cope with that . Um , delegating tasks is something that I normally would do , but for this , it's , it was specifically for my eyes only and my job , and I was just able to put the work in , um , put extra work in after school and at night and on weekends , and that's okay . Um , because I know that I needed to get the job done and I needed to get the job done . Right . So , um , yeah . So that's my answer to reacting in a stressful situation .","So I'm so glad that you asked this question about keeping commitments because I do feel very strongly about being able to keep commitments at work . Um , however , there has been a time or there was a time recently when I did have to decommit to something . Um , and I know that that sounds really bad . So just , um , let me explain . Um , at school we have several different committees that teachers can choose to be on . Um , some of them are , um , more academic oriented and some of them are more like social and staff oriented . Um , and because I love my school and I love my students , uh , I volunteered to be on several different committees . Um , one of them being the sit team , which is the school improvement team . And in this , uh , team , uh , we go over the whole entire school . Um , and we talk about , um , what makes our school run well , what things we could be doing differently . We take a look at test scores and reading and math , both of them , and we try to put some interventions in . Um , and that is a very important team for me to be on with my knowledge and expertise over the past 25 years in education . Um , I was also involved in a team called IIT , which was an intervention type of committee where teachers that needed help would , uh , come and bring students to the table and uh , teachers would give them ideas of what they could try with their students , whether it was a behavior chart or any type of behavior mod program , um , just anything to get different ideas . And , um , I was also on a social committee , which was where we would plan fun things for the staff and um , fun things for the students . And , um , we had a lot of people on that committee and I have been on that committee for a while , but the time that was needed for the betterment of the school , for the sick committee and the time that was needed to help other teachers with their , um , with their students , um , with my , my ideas , um , they needed me more than the social part . So , um , I ended up quitting the social committee . Um , I wouldn't say quitting . I said , I'll try to make as many meetings as I can , but I can't . Um , I can't come to all of them . And , you know , they understood , they understood that most teachers are on one committee . And so me being on two committees was , um , was a lot anyway . So , um , I think the outcome was okay and I still always , um , get the minutes from the meeting , so I'm able to see what's going on as well as , um , I , like , I , like I said , I try to come to go to the meetings as much as possible .",4,2.666666667,3.333333333,3.333333333,3
132,Pe7frud-b2jhwn,"I think this is a very important question to ask , so thank you . Uh , there have been many times where I've had to respond to dynamic and fast changing environments , um , in a variety of positions that I've held over the span of my career . Um , I think one of the most prescient examples would be having to change tracks because of the pandemic . My former position had me offering in person services , um , and supports to folks in the workplace , uh , community gathering spaces , all sorts of different kinds of ways to build community and with the , um , with the pandemic and all of the uncertainty that bring , um , I had to really think about how to offer these opportunities in meaningful ways in a time of uncertainty online and , uh , and , and the programming that I had to do and had to also keep in mind the fact that we were experiencing societal trauma simultaneously to try to attain our goals . So it's , it's , um , you become quite practiced at changing plans on the fly , adjusting to different circumstances and , um , being aware of how to meet the needs of a diverse audience .","I would say that one of the biggest challenges that I faced was when I , uh , took a contract position with the municipality where I live and my job was to facilitate a working group looking to resolve , um , some challenges that community members had in completing community led projects funded by the city . Uh , one of the biggest challenges was understanding that the folks at the table had very different communication styles and very different goals coming into this working group . There's a re working group of the working group consisted of even numbers of community members , volunteers and of city staff . And the biggest challenge was to find a common ground where the participants were no longer feeling defensive , uh , about their experiences or the rules of the organization so that they could come together and generate really meaningful , uh , suggestions for improving the system . Um , on the outside it might've looked like I spent , I was spending too much time on the light and airy things , um , you know , conversational , breaking the ice , getting to know one another . But in the end it allowed for us to really get at the heart of the issue . And to , uh , create a list of recommendations for the city to improve those profits processes for everyone's benefit . So sometimes , um , establishing those relationships at the beginning , uh , will lead to better outcomes in the longterm , especially when you're looking at short term events that need a high level of , uh , cooperation and collaboration .","I think one of the best examples of this that shows , um , my ability to manage complex situations actually comes from my personal life rather than my professional life . And , uh , again , it relates to life under the pandemic . Uh , we had to make a lot of decisions about education for our kiddo during this time . And , uh , um , when we were making those decisions , there wasn't a lot of information available about , um , the best way forward and what was really happening because of these campaigns of misinformation , you know , it being an emergent situation , all of those things . And we had to very quickly make a decision about what our kiddo was going to be doing for kindergarten , you know , the year that's supposed to set the tone for their schooling experiences . Um , obviously we all experienced the situation of , of um , conflicting information , uh , incomplete information , um , questioning our ability to trust and information . And in the end it became a matter of prioritizing the wellbeing of the , of my kiddo who we knew under these circumstances would be best educated at home . And it had far reaching consequences across the span of our entire lives . But in the end , uh , it was the best decision for everyone involved . And it took some of the pressure off of the local school systems who were managing the same issues , but four classes of 30 instead of one child .","Because my job is forward facing and I'm responsible for the programming for a very large organization around my area of expertise . I , um , I'm often in situations that are , um , high pressure or stressful . And , uh , what I have really learned is the importance of knowing thyself in these situations . Knowing what your limits are , knowing what your capacity is , knowing , um , also what skills that you don't have an aren't the sharpest so that it will allow you to build teams based on strengths , the strengths that compliment each other , uh , rather than teams where everyone shares the same sort of talent profile , if you will . Um , in these situations . Uh , I plan a very large year Lee event that , um , encompasses actually five different institutions . So there it's a huge undertaking , um , that has a very , very finite deadline . And the best way to do it was to be , uh , have , be well-organized . Know who my teammates were , who I could count on for support , making sure to prioritize my health over the span of the project to make sure that I could get to the project , to its launch date so that everyone could enjoy it and feel successful . Um , the outcome consistently by following those has been hugely successful to the point where we have received national recognition for our work . And , uh , it's , it's exciting to have that level of knowledge of yourself so that you can produce the best work possible .","This is always such an interesting question to answer cause basically we're being asked to tell on ourselves , but do so in a way that still makes you hireable . So , uh , I always , I always have a chuckle because it's like how much do I do ? I say , um , I think because of , uh , working in multifaceted complex and dynamic environments for so long that running into these situations is actually quite common . Um , sometimes the best like timelines , uh , will still be interrupted because of emergent work or situations beyond your control . And , um , so it's hard to say a very specific example , but to me , managing any of these situations comes down to the relationships that you have built and your ability to communicate . Hopefully with those good relationships and communication , you'll be able to avoid these kinds of situations . Uh , especially if you're able to delegate different , uh , different roles and responsibilities . However , it's inevitable that there will be a situation that arises to me being , um , upfront and clear about the situation , about the realities of what's going on is imperative , but also being very clear on , um , the , the latitude that , that you need to reach the out the stated goals of that particular task . Um , hopefully those are ways , uh , hopefully through those dialogues that you'll be able to identify , um , you know , if I need to re prioritize this hire , what are the pieces that I can then deprioritize , prioritize to allow me space and time to do this ? Um , it's very important to me to also protect myself in those situations and not be , um , coerced or , um , pushed to doing things that are outside of the scope of my work or outside of our contract . So I work very hard to meet those deadlines . However , there are reasonable limits to what I am able to do as a human being who has other things happening in our , in her life .",3.333333333,3,2.666666667,3,3
133,Pmg567f-7rrwpj,"Um , hi . Uh , so I've been asked to describe , um , how I would adapt to a changing or complex , complex situation at work . Um , and so in this situation I , um , had to fill in for a teammate of mine . Um , we were working on a big project , um , with a really short deadline , um , and uh , unexpectedly somebody had to pull it up . This project . Um , I had to jump in last minute . Um , and I wasn't up to date on all of the details . So I worked really well with this small team . Um , we had a really great communication skills and , um , just really supported each other while we work to our best abilities to get this project done . Um , this was done by us being really efficient , communicating and , um , working really well as a team . Um , and , uh , we were successful in this , in this project and , um , um , we're able to get it out on time .","Hi . Um , so for , um , a situation where I had to set goals that were hard to achieve just because of the magnitude of this project . Um , and so in this example , I was hired as a lead on a big field project , um , and I really wanted to collect as much data as possible , which meant visiting a lot of field sites , um , which is , uh , it takes a lot of time , a lot of energy . Um , but I was really determined to gather as much data as possible and make this the best project that I could . Um , and so the way that I achieved the school was , uh , being really communicated with my team , um , telling them the plan , the timeline , the budget , what we wanted to accomplish in these , in these certain amount of trips , um , and keeping them well in the loop and , um , so everybody can work to their best ability . I also worked on a timeline so we could be as efficient as possible and we did go into the field , so we're not wasting time getting ready or like missing things when we were trying to , um , get as much work done as possible . Um , and so kind of being efficient and communicated and really stepping into that leadership role , but , and keeping everybody in my team informed , enabled us to get to all those sites and collect as much data as we could . Um , and just be like a really efficient team .","Um , so in this example , I was project lead in a field project involving a small wheel . And , um , during the smolt season , there's a fish that come down the river and they get caught in the smoke wheel . And on certain days there can be a lot of fish . And so on this particular day there was more fish than I'd ever dealt with and it was just me and one other , um , team member . Um , and so it was a really kind of critical moment to decide how we were going to process all these animals , um , because we don't want any of them to die . And , um , it's , you know , it's , it can be stressful because you're handling live animals in a remote situation . Um , and so in the moment , um , we kind of , I went back and forth trying to figure out what's the best decision , you know , should I go with my , my gut that says , um , I should just deal with what I know that we're capable of doing and not kind of going too above and beyond . Because we are dealing with live animals . And I , and I don't want to get into a situation where we're putting them at risk , even though that meant not processing , um , as much as we normally would . Um , and so it wasn't easy , but I went with my gut and I , um , processed what we could , and we released the rest . And , and after explaining it to my manager when we got back , they were super supportive and , and , um , understanding of , of the decision in the moment . Um , and so that was just made me feel good that we worked well under pressure and , and did what was right .","Hi . Um , so in this situation I'm going to describe a time that I was dealing with a lot of pressure . Um , so , um , I was again hired as um , a biologist and as a , as a project manager for a big project . Um , and um , I rented a piece of equipment for three weeks and this was um , to do a huge field study , um , involving a lot of sites and collecting a lot of data and it was me and one other person that were on this project . Um , and just , uh , the amount of work that we needed to kind of squish into three weeks just took a ton of planning . We worked very closely together . Again , just always had really good communication . Um , working with one another , keeping each other up to date on what we're working on , just to be as efficient as possible and making like a really excellent timeline of like , uh , where we were going , what we were doing , what we wanted to accomplish during those three weeks , making sure that everything was purchased , that we were within our budget , kind of checking all the boxes before we actually got the piece of equipment so we could just hit the ground running once it came . Um , and it came and it was a whirlwind three weeks , but we got , we got everything done that we wanted and , and , um , just collected so much great data and it was a big success for us and our company .","Um , so in this example , I was again hired as a project manager to complete a habitat assessment project for my company . And , um , I , at this time I had multiple projects . It wasn't during summer , there's a lot of field work and um , it's not uncommon to become just a bit overworked . Um , and so one of the projects I had was doing , um , habitat assessments on a local stream . Um , so this involved , um , just going out to their stream , collecting some data , doing some measurements , not overly hard work , um , and it was pretty local . Um , but just kind of lay out on top of other things . I was doing it , it was becoming difficult to get out there and get the work done on time . And so , um , uh , amazingly we had all of these summer students , um , at that time and it just happened that , that this , I asked my supervisor and like this was okay , we were allowed to do this . I took out a group of summer students , um , had them trained on , um , how to collect this data , had them trained in the safety . Um , and so I was always in communication with them , but they were super excited because they got to go into the field and , and kind of do this new skill . And I was excited because I was not only being able to teach and kind of , um , get this younger group excited about science and about work . Um , but it also freed up a lot of my time . And so it ended up being just a really great collaboration , um , altogether and , um , a really positive learning experience for me and for them .",3,3.2,3,3.333333333,3
134,Pv7qi7q-h9whp9,"A time that I had to adapt to a changing or complex environment at work was during coven when everything went online during quarantine and remote work became more common . Um , we had to adapt to that situation by , um , learning new technology , figuring out what technology worked best for our work , um , and hiring new staff that knew how to , uh , adapt to these things and as well as train our existing staff on how to use this to ensure a smooth transition from this , we were able to actually make more connections globally , um , hire talents and staff that didn't necessarily work within the confines of the city that we , um , reside in . And we're able to sell to global clients , um , in a way that we weren't able to before due to the nature of online work .","Um , because of covert , we had to reschedule our cities , um , pride celebration several times and they ended up happening in October , but we ended up only having a month to plan and get all of this together , which if , you know , anything about planning large scale events is not enough time . Um , so really it came down to utilizing the staff that we already had on board on making sure that we were very clear with what roles people were given and what people's tasks were in getting ready for pride and also recruiting volunteers in the area . Um , and making sure that we did hire two new people , one to manage vendors and talent and another to manage volunteers to make sure everything ran smoothly , um , and do risk assessments , uh , as that's really , really important . Uh , and if we had a great pride celebration , um , that was just as successful as two years ago before Kobe , uh , and garnered thousands of dollars for the organization . Um , but it was a lot of work within one month . I wouldn't do it again if I had the choice , but it was out of our hands .","In a situation where we had an altercation between two staff members . Um , we had to try to , of course keep everyone safe as the most important , um , piece , but at the same time make sure that both people felt safe and felt , um , that they were being listened to , to , uh , to avoid , um , further complications down the line . Uh , so in the moment it involved making the snap decision of they have to go to either ends of the , um , office and , um , stay there basically while we tried to figure out the situation with both of them and then trying to make sure that they felt listened to afterwards , um , debriefing one-on-one , um , involving the board if they didn't feel comfortable speaking to one of their supervisors or one of their direct supervisors . Um , so it was a lot of trying to make sure that we didn't make the situation worse in the moment , but also a lot of mediation afterwards to make sure that there wasn't further complications . Um , with the issue in that both people were able to retain their jobs as they were both amazing employees . Um , and it turned out great . Um , and they did end up speaking to other members of the board to figure it out .","During university . Um , one semester I took six classes instead of the required four or five classes . Um , I did this of my own volition in order to make sure that I could get my minor , um , within the four years of an undergraduate degree . Uh , however , and it was , it was fine , um , until the finals portion of the semester during which I got a new strain of swine flu , um , got into a car crash that I was not at fault for , but I got T-boned at an intersection , uh , and I got whiplash . So in order to deal with having six finals in the coming two weeks while having all of this going on as well as the final project , I got the final project moved . Um , that a two day extension , only a two day extension because I knew that if I waited too long or gave myself too much time , it would kind of just drag the situation along . I had already studied quite a bit , so I felt fine . Not um , moving any of the test dates back , test dates back cause I thought I would be probably all right by then . And I was feeling much better and didn't , was no longer sick by the time the actual tests rolled around . Um , so yeah , communicating with my professors what was going on . I did mention to a few that had , um , the earliest test dates that I was sick with swine flu and may have had to move those back , but that didn't end up happening . And even with all of these complications , because of my preparation beforehand and before these events occurred , I was able to get out of finals with a , um , a plus average in the end despite everything . So I was quite proud of myself for how I handled that situation .","I took on a bit too much responsibility as a board member of a local pride organization , um , on top of my full time work and other volunteer responsibilities . Um , I didn't quit the position even though it was a lot , but I did talk to the board about what capacity I had at that moment . Um , what responsibilities I might be able to delegate to other people . Um , and what I could maybe put on the backburner burner to revisit when I had more time . And really it was all about communication , um , organizing priorities , um , and figuring out who else , what other talent we could use basically , uh , and just kind of positioning , um , existing staff and volunteers in ways that were beneficial to the society as a whole . And I think it did end up , um , resulting in people getting a bit more experience with higher level positions and some of those people that helped with the , uh , tasks that I had didn't have as much time for . It ended up becoming board members later . Uh , so it did end up quite positive . And I think the key to that was just communication , being realistic about what I was able to do and not taking too much on after that . I definitely learned a lesson from that and know what my capacity is .",3.666666667,3.25,3.333333333,3.333333333,3.666666667
135,P6di8sr-6rbypa,"I'd say probably one of the most complex environments that we've had to go through in our industry is , um , everything that's happened with co-fund 18 in the past two years . I'd say that I'm definitely someone who can easily adapt to changes at work . Um , I try to remember that I'm not the only person going through them , which makes it definitely easier to connect with our coworkers and to find the best way to overcome a new situation is together . Um , other than this , I try and see new changes as opportunities to grow and learn and I know that that can positively affect my career . And when covert happened , we had to , um , we had to change our tactics , our sales tactics and we had to try and do this curbside and via the phone service . Um , so in this we had to transition to a quicker , more efficient sales approach to our customers , um , while also maintaining our really high loyalty levels . Um , and sometimes when we encounter change and we have no control over , um , the best thing you can do is just to , can remain positive and open minded and adapt quickly to it . Um , I always try and focus on adapting rather than fighting it . Um , and also try and identify what causes the change . I'm not afraid to get support from others . And definitely during this time we needed all the support we could get from our head office as well as her district managers . Um , and in the end , our company was successful through the co , the coven lockdown . Um , we are still successful to this day .","So one of the hardest projects that I've had to achieve , um , was to graduate university with my master's , um , in bioarchaeology , um , while maintaining a full time position at my local museum . Um , during this time I was able to still maintain a 4.0 GPA . I was also a member of my university students social science association , and it was also working as many hours as I possibly could in the meantime . Um , it required a lot of intense dedication and organization . I had an agenda that was a chalk full of color coded dates and timings to make sure that I was always on time for my classes and my meetings . Um , as well as for all of my shifts , um , it required a lot of planning , um , a lot of caffeine and a lot of motivation to continue on . Um , once I was able to graduate , I realized that reaching the goal show me that I could dedicate myself to my career and it felt like , um , a lot of things were opened up to me and I had so much accomplishment over this .","So a situation where I needed to make a decision quickly was , um , at my last job , um , in retail we get a lot of , um , situations that can happen . And , and one night I did make a snap decision , um , when someone tried to Rob the store , um , it was a transaction late at night , a customer came up and he had his hand in his pocket and he declared that he had a weapon and I was to hand over the cash . Now in our training , we are told just to hand the money over . There has to be no arguments in that manner , just hand it over for our safety . Um , and so I had opened the drawer . Um , we do hall also have an emergency button , which I had , um , press without him noticing . Um , but at the time I did notice that there was another customer in the store , a mother , um , and her younger child . Um , and they were coming up . They didn't see this individual . They didn't hear the interaction and they were approaching the cash to check out for the evening . Uh , and I didn't want to risk that . The , um , the mother and the little child to be hurt . Um , so at that moment I made a very rash decision . I stepped out of my booth in front of the mother and the daughter and I very loudly said , take the money . Um , he reached in , grabbed the money . He fled . Um , the mother , I don't think she realized what was happening at the time . She pulled her child back when the situation was over . I did explain to the mother , I just didn't want to take any chances with the child being in the way . So I took the step in front of the child . Um , when my manager , um , heard about the situation afterwards , he was , he was happy that I had followed the procedures . Um , and that I also made the choice to keep that other customer safe .","So there was a time when I had to cope with a high pressure or stressful situation . Um , and it was at university . Normally pressure for me is , is important . Um , good pressure such as having assignments or upcoming deadlines . Exams helps me stay motivated and productive . Of course there are times though where I can have too much pressure and that can lead to stress . Um , and normally I'm very skilled at balancing multiple projects and meeting deadlines , um , and the ability to , um , and this ability prevents me from being overly stressed . However , it was my third year of university , um , and my sister-in-law tragically passed away . Um , the next week I had a major midterm exam . Um , about a week and a half later my grandfather passed away and at the time , um , I had a midterm paper that I had due and then days later I literally had to have my wisdom teeth extracted . Um , there was so much pressure , so much grief . Um , and I also had to meet my deadlines . So I went to my counselor , um , and I talked with them about it and I broke it down into smaller assignments . Try to react to the situations and not the stress . Um , and then times where I found that I couldn't react to the situations , I found that it was , I found proper support so that I wasn't overwhelming and burning myself out . Um , uh , created a schedule that would allow me to break down these projects to accomplish them in one step at a time . Um , in the one time I did ask for a slight extension on my project so I could meet the deadline and not hand in a half finished project . Um , and in that time I was able to complete my projects , um , and get them done .","So there was a time where I experienced difficulty keeping a commitment that I've made . Um , due to other important priorities at work . Uh , working in retail customer service , it's not always possible to handle everything urgent all at once . Um , it's important to know kind of what your greatest priority is . Um , and my role is assistant manager had many responsibilities . Um , and there was a day that , you know , the needs of the store outweighed the needs of what I needed to get done that day in order to fulfill my job . Um , for example , we had a customer come in , um , make a mess on the floor . Um , we have to clean that up urgently because it's a safety hazard . Um , and my job that day was to work on the sales display , which is a huge thing for us because , uh , the displays target our customers and it increases our sales . Um , and that day I had to clean up the store . We had a numerous amounts of messages for some reason , um , and we also had a really difficult challenging employee interaction that day . Um , and so from this experience , I've learned to study the job , learn what's most important in the job . And if I'm not sure , I do have my support team , I do have my management team to , um , to fall back on . I do use my best judgment and ask my manager after the fact if I've acted correctly . I look for feedback .

And then all of a sudden I think to , um , out of like 15 people on my team , um , quit at the same time . But at that time we were working , we're actually working on , um , a billion in projects . So , um , since we were short of on the team , people decided to quit at the same time without really any like notice like , um , previous notice . Um , I had to kind of like regroup everyone and then um , uh , gather everyone together and then gave them like different priorities and different , um , objective objectives to work on so that we could like finish the project in on time without , uh , two people missing two people . And then I had to do that and then I had to like kind of pretty much like talk to every single person one on one to see like what their problems were and then what , how they envisioned the project as well . So that was a very difficult time . But I managed to like pull everything off by kind of like setting priorities for each and every person all over again , um , to meet the demands and the new requirements on time .","Um , there was one time that I had to work on a project with other team members . Um , it's not that the project itself wasn't necessarily difficult or hard to achieve , but there like two new members with two people who are new to the job . So basically what I did was the first step that I did was I paired those new peoples up with uh , um , really experienced , uh , people who had hands on experience so that like the new people can , I could learn faster and then like kind of get to hang up like how things work and then what day had to do , um , for the project . And second of all , the step that I took was I made social work to um , to have like , like a regular meeting to , to see like if everyone was on the same page about the project and then how things were going . I constantly , I made sure to like spend time checking in with them . And then to have like at least , uh , I think like at least a two to three meet or I at least had like three to three meetings a week to make sure that we were , um , at pace we were not like falling behind and stuff . So , um , we ultimately reached a goal , um , by working , um , together as a team and also , um , the steps that were basically the sketch that I took was like , make sure that new people weren't like falling behind . And by like putting them or having , putting them or pairing them with , uh , more experienced people or like , man , well , not necessarily manager a world . One more explain to me , experienced people and also second of all just speak . Sure . I made sure that we had a regular team meeting to talk about the objects , objectives and then also the project .","Um , there was a presentation that I had to work on with my team members . Well mostly I wasn't just in charge of the presentation , so I kinda like , cause I was the one who called the shots . But the conflicting information that I was getting from different team members was , is that um , the color and then the font that I use for the presentation of the PPT , um , um , wasn't I thought like I used the best option or like I could , I did like what I could do the best , but other team members weren't necessarily , I didn't necessarily agree with my choice or my decision . So I had to talk to different people to see like , uh , if the presentation PPT , the background color for my PVT , um , might go better with a white instead of like black or bluish color or even like the font , it felt like times new Roman time , time times new Roman or a different font . So , uh , it wasn't necessarily like a hard thing to achieve or like go through or get through , but I was getting conflicting with different information from different people . It's like , Oh , Chloe may , it might be better to go with , uh , call it black so that you can actually use like white font for people who like , read better or like , I think it's better to , um , go with , uh , the , the light blue for the background color for your PPT because you might be easy for like , easy on people's eyes . So like that was , I was getting all these , this different complex information , but , um , it was , well , once again , I was the one who was in charge of , uh , the projects or the presentation . So I was open to listening to different ideas . But , um , after all , it was , um , it was me who decided , uh , um , who , it was me who made the decision , final decision , but I made sure to , like , I made sure that everybody's opinions were heard . And then I was like , I kind of took everyone's opinion into consideration , but after all , I made the final decision .","Um , when I was in school , I was in the psychology class or chorus . And then , um , during this time I had a project to work on and I also had to do , like I had to do like weekly , um , test or quiz . And then on top of that , um , there was my psychology final exam , uh , waiting for meat as well . So I had all these different , um , um , things that I had to do accomplish in a very short period of time . So my response was like , Oh , well , obviously I was under so much stress , but I made sure to like prioritize everything . And then I kinda like had this timeline for each and every project , presentation and exams and quizzes so that I didn't miss them where I didn't do poorly on them . So that was my initial response . And my also approach was like , once again , timeline and then , um , made sure like , okay , this , this , um , exam will be like 15% of my , like my 15 person Mark . And this is , um , quit is not as important as this because quiz only takes up like 5% of my whole Mark . So I made sure that I spend more time working on a project or a quiz , but , um , was like , was more important for my final marks . So I did that . And then the outcome was phenomenal because , um , I managed to do everything and submit everything on time . And also I did really good on like all my tests and quizzes . So that was my approach and also the outcome .","Uh , when I was pretty new to this , my current job , I didn't have much time , like , like personal life . I w I didn't have any , it was really hard for me to balance between my personal life and work because my workload was crazy . I had so much to work on and so much to learn and so much to adapt to in my work environment . So I had this like really good or it was , um , my , I , well my mom , um , was my mom's 50 , 50 , I think 55th birthday . And then it , it wasn't really a big deal because , um , she , that year she just like had surgery and then she pulled through and then she recovered it very fast . She , everything healed up . And then it was such a big deal to be there for him , uh , with my family for my mom's birthday . But I wasn't able to make it because of my workload and also like things that I had to do at work . So my approach was , well , since it's really important to also spend time with my mom , so I wait her birthday . Um , I , well first of all I told her that I'm sorry I couldn't be there for this year is your 50th birthday , but I made sure I told her , I will make sure that I'll be there for your next birthday for sure in person and then we can spend time . So instead of , um , kind of like not getting upset with myself , I told her I sent her like a card and flowers and also , uh , the week after that , um , I went to see my parents and then spend time with them and also , um , this toll then like everything's going really well at my job and to , to like not have them worry about me . And also , um , yeah , at that time , like work kind of came first or before my family . So I did that and also , but I made sure to spend time with my mom to celebrate my mom's birthday and a week later . So I told her like , happy belated birthday .",3,2.666666667,2.333333333,3,3.333333333

Uh , but everyone had to adapt to the change , including myself . Uh , it involved commuting , um , an extra 20 minutes in the morning as well as in the evening . It was two , two towns away . So it was about 24 miles longer each way . Um , it was necessary cause we needed additional space and we decided that this would be the best , best way to go . The company's best interest would be to go to a larger space . And the newer building , uh , was more costly , but provided the space that we needed to , to continue .","Timely said goals for project that were hard to achieve . We're trying to collect more money every month of the year that that passed by then the previous month . So naturally February was more difficult than January and March was more difficult than February and so forth throughout the rest of the year . Uh , the actions taken in order to achieve the results were to work , uh , longer hours , but to also work smarter , to try to collect a lot of the major accounts early in the month and using overnight systems such as FedEx or ups to deliver the checks and get them before the end of the month was part of the strategy that was necessary to attain the results that we , that we wanted .","Situation where needed to make an important decision quickly . And we're faced with information from multiple sources was whether or not we , um , had a flood in the building . We were told that there was a flood . Some people confirm , some people said , that's not the case . I was away from the office . I was on the road . So the outcome of the final decision was , let's , let's move on . The assumption that what we were told is in fact true , that there wasn't a place turned out to be true . So we're glad that we did move out and we called in the necessary help to remediate the flood . Uh , it was , uh , it was , it was not a pretty sight , but we dealt with it .","High pressure or stressful situation . That work was when the company announced that our department was moving to Kansas , we had a choice either to go to Kansas or to basically look for a new job . Um , the reason given was that it was cheaper for the company to function in Kansas . Uh , I disagreed with the decision because the company was not losing money in the state of Connecticut where it was functioning before the , you know , that was when it was made . But the outcome was that I did not go . And two years later , the company actually closed one out of business . So it worked out for the best .","A time when I experienced the difficulty keeping the commitment was , um , every year my family has a annual outing to visit the grave sites of members of the family that had passed away and I had to work . Uh , usually the day that was selected was a Sunday , and that was one of the days that I would drive a cab , uh , as a side side hustle or a side gig . And it was difficult or impossible not to work that day because , uh , it was the day that was , I was counted on to work and therefore I had to decide or miss going to the graves , uh , or go to work . Most times I missed going to the grave site and work , I think once or twice I made an exception to that .

138,Puz7krn-9tuwd5,", The changing complex environment that I and many others had to adapt to work was the , during the onset of the rotavirus two years ago when I had many jobs and mine included transitioning from mostly or fully in person to fully remote . Um , my experience , um , there was a lot of , uh , challenging effort that went into that transition , uh , especially in the initial few days of uncertainty and anxiety around the current virus and , uh , how , um , how extensive the virus would be to , um , deal with , um , while maintaining no full workload and full 40 hour a week workload and dealing with the challenges of remote video column , uh , the song coworkers and clients . Um , and the challenges of , uh , keeping in contact with , through , while , uh , transitioning to the media .","One of my current projects is very lofty goals and some hard deadlines to meet . Um , project is you're in the midst of pre-development for a four story mixed use office or for sort of mixed use commercial and residential building in my city . And , um , we are in the midst of acquiring the deed to the property through the city . And one of our funding sources requires that we have that duty in hand by the end of the year . But unfortunately , due to the molasses , like structure of the cities , uh , government , um , it seems that we will be cutting it very close with meeting that goal . However , we need to meet that goal to , uh , maintain our funding to go nuts . Um , and I'm very optimistic that we will be able to hit that goal as long as you know , I , as the project manager , as the real estate product manager , um , maintaining the connections I need to keep everyone speed to fire to achieve these goals .","Anytime I find myself in a competitive job offer situation where I have that with multiple employers , um , and have multiple offers extended to me and I find myself in a situation like this where , you know , I'm flattered that , uh , several employers find my candidacy , uh , worthy of extending , offered to me . But of course , each employee either has their own biases that they are trying to convince me to join their firm specifically . Um , so , uh , even a situation such as that , which I have found myself in several times , uh , I find that the employer ask the most probing questions that I need to , to establish what really needed from is about . Um , so that I have sufficient information to weigh several offers , that kind of disparate salary over time demands or cultural sort of fit differences between other things . Um , and ultimately , you know , really a little bit of a gut check , like pros and cons , and eventually settle on what you believe to be the best option and go from there .","Under a stressful situation I found myself in that was a product of my own , um , mistakes let's say , um , was when I was an ER was an entry level engineer . Uh , my first full time position , I neglected to double check some calculations that I ran and , uh , several weeks or months later was still basing . So some of my assumptions from that unchecked work , um , in my progressed design That was doing , you know , a month later and it came to light . Thankfully it can be like , um , that I had neglected to do this double check in time that we were able to , um , I was able to do a little bit of extra work on the weekends and evenings to catch up to where I ought to have been , uh , by that time and crisis was averted . But , um , only because of a good oversight by my superiors . And it's certainly learned the lesson that I need to double check my own work and have others double check my work . Um , especially in a life safety engineering design position as I find myself .","A good rule of thumb in client facing work is to under promise and over deliver . And , um , when you find yourself in a situation where maybe you did not under promise and over deliver , um , it becomes incumbent on you to make up that difference . And if that means you personally need to work 60 to 80 hours a week , when do you have plans ? Do you want me at 40 hours a week to close that gap or to lean on your peers or colleagues to know , I apologize for the excess , um , time to make up the deadlines , but you'll make it back in , come that next time . Um , I think it's essential that , uh , any client work , product client , any work product that is going to your client needs to maintain the standards that the firm that you represent , uh , puts forward .

139,Prigqp6-95tywn,"So one thing we've encountered when doing a major project , we encountered a number of different changing environments . One is the workforce and so as there's been more of a labor shortage , it's hard to find those skill workers that you need to have those key personnel on your project and you really don't want to settle for second best and then the client doesn't want us to settle for second best either . So that is a major thing that I've always had have a plan in place where I'm going to find my staffing , where I'm going to retain my key personnel from previous projects , people that I know of that are solid in the industry and people that I want on my team and being able to adapt to the changing labor market has definitely been a challenge . Another thing is a supply chain supply chain has been extremely challenging in this current year . We're finding it difficult to get in a lot of our basic supplies things before it would have been no problem . Now that becomes more of an issue with the shortages and with the time delays that can throw us into cost overruns . It could throw us into time overruns . And so having a solid plan in place for these things , having a solid list of suppliers that you can count on and even multiple suppliers so that if one is not able to fulfill , you can always turn to another . Those are things that I use to help manage these types of situations and adapt .","So sometimes you run into a situation where you've got some pretty steep goals in a project . In one such project , we had a client that wanted to build proprietary system and this system was going to be the backbone of their tech organization . And so one of the things that I had to , one of the goals I had to achieve was I had to find the right people to do the software development . And I've got a couple of solid teams , but they were working on various other projects . And so it's no as the easiest thing to pull somebody off one project , especially when you've got another project that needs to be completed at the same time . So what I do to achieve these goals is I make sure and match the right tech with the right project and I make sure and follow up and give them as much support as possible so that they can fulfill their duties and they don't have to worry about the things that I could easily take care of . And so being able to give excellent support and guidance , being able to pick the right people and put them in the right place and have them on the right project at the right time is , is really key to ensuring that these goals are met and met in a timely manner . Another thing is dealing with budgeting . Budgeting is something that many times it's very easy to overrun . And so being able to plan and drill down to the minute detail and keep all this in concert is again key to controlling your costs . Being able to spot things before so that you can be in a proactive posture when you see a roadblock coming up , dealing with it early and of course transparency with the client , um , that helps prevent a lot of cost overruns . Having a wide , vast array of suppliers is another thing that helps a lot . And being able to go through and pick the best pricing on various segments of the project .","During a large project , we were developing some infrastructure for a major client and my development team was telling me that the most efficient way to complete this project was to write in the Cobra development environment . There was an expert within that environment that was available and so naturally I PR I was pursuing this individual to get them on our team . During this time I had a lot of conflicting information on the programmer's capabilities . Um , there was a lot of conflicting information if he would be available and even if he would be the right person for the job . So I wanted to research it as this is going to be a major Keystone of our development . I wanted to research it thoroughly . I was getting a lot of conflicting information . So what I opted to do was to meet with and interview this programmer on the Chromebook , on the Cobra development environment and make a judgment call on it . I called in some of my key people off the development team and also a good friend of mine that is an expert in the field to sit in on the interview . And we had a technical interview at which time we decided to offer the individual and we were able to retain them for the project . The outcome was excellent because with this superstar on our team were able to develop the project ahead of time , schedule under budget , and a client was extremely pleased , which led to us a future contract already and possibly more future contracts .","We were working on a major project and we were in the final three weeks of the project when the code pandemic kit . And so there was a mandate that we redeemed , not essential and we were not able to open our office , which is where we all worked . Um , so my development team was , was not able to legally come to work during that time . The , the client was still expecting the result and this is a major client and really the backbone of our strategy for the year . We could not lose this client . And so in this stressful situation , I stopped and considered all my options and I made a plan . But the plan ended up being , was a complete work at home environment . So we switched from working in an office , collaborating around a table around a series of computers to everybody working at home . I was able to set this infrastructure up through a company that does distance learning . And so part of my method was to reach out to various companies to see if we could do this over zoom call , if we could do this over , um , a WebEx . And as it turned out , we found a distance learning company for very reasonable price that would set us up and able us to work in a virtual environment together . And that way I was able to keep the operation flowing and we all worked from home . As a result , we were able to get the project done on time . We actually came in under budget , even with the additional expense of having to work at home . And the client was not only retained but very pleased and it led to a future contract .","I had a colleague that teaches at a local college and I made a commitment to come and speak at his class each week for a period of eight weeks . During this time , we had a major client that had added some additional requirements onto a project that we were working on . And so it created a lot of additional stress and a lot of additional workload in the office . So the time that I had initially committed to going to the college to speak to the students during this time , it was in conflict with my responsibilities to the team . I wanted to maintain my commitment , and at the same time I wanted to be there for my team . So the solution was I was able to work it out where I could appear via video call in the classroom , answering questions for the students , giving a presentation on the module that they were learning that week , and giving some industry insight . And at the same time , I was able to remain in my office where I could still be there supporting my team and the project that we were working on , which was a very important project .",3,3,3,3,3.333333333

I spearheaded the efforts to begin a transition from our current model of like an in house solution to a cloud based solution using several different offices within my agency . I was able to design and implement a three tiered system that uses both very fast storage , a mid tiered storage , and then it low and slow archiving storage . We were able to spin up a 300 terabyte server in the cloud in approximately nine months and achieve a level that we had never even dreamed of .

When I first started teaching , I was teaching mathematics and reading . Uh , my second job , however , was in social studies . That was one of the most challenging changes from mathematics to social studies . I researched , uh , thoroughly the , uh , materials . I started typing up notes during the summertime . I started getting to know the other teachers , reaching out to them , asking questions . I tried to , uh , connect with other people in the area , in other counties that had experience and ask them for their advice . I tried to be professional , reach out through different networks and through people and I feel that I was able to generate experience from learning from others and also implement that to get ready for my own classroom . I feel that over the years , um , it must have been a very successful time because I have been teacher of the year for , uh , eighth street , middle school .

I started using different modalities of learning . I looked at whether people were interested in pictures and tried to connect to pictures . I would read material to them to try to overcome some of their inability to read some of the higher order thinking skills . Um , I worked on after school programs to try to help them . Well , we played games as well as learned . I gave rewards such as candy and reinforced positive behaviors . I felt that making school somewhat more enjoyable but still focusing on learning would be a trait that they would need to be successful . I even created a website that had many different links to games that they might play . Why I observed them after school and worked with them . I made sure I praised them , created a student of the week , a student of the month , and recognize the students on bulletin boards . So we praise them . We recognize their successes . We try to recognize where they were failing and counsel them so that I would point out where they had done things that were right , where they had done things that were incorrect and what we could do to overcome those .

And then one employee was an advocate for the person being accused and said they would never have stolen anything under any circumstances . I myself had not seen anything .

Uh , it required videoing , uh , students who , um , re re this involved videoing the me , the teacher . Um , and what we had done in one particular classroom . Our , it had to give up our planning time to make sure that we were calling parents and saying , your child had not been on the computer system . We had to recognize that some people didn't have access to technology . We had to print up material that went along with our teaching , um , and make sure that it was easily accessible . We did run some papers home . Uh , of course , this just created meaning more demands on our outside time and it did cut into our time . We felt that it was justified with the children's education . We felt that the matter was serious enough that it would require , um , more from us and we were willing to give it . Um , I believe that in the end the students did learn . There were some that did not . Um , I will repeat that it was not 100% completely successful .

In the end , I believe we learned many things from situation and going forward we'll be able to implement some new strategies and not be able to make some of the same mistakes that we had made earlier .","This is a very interesting question . People are not machines . They do have lives outside of work . They have families , they also have physical bodies that will be sick from time to time . But of course work demands will still go on . So one of the things you need to do is always have a plan in place for when you might not be there due to unforeseen actions . Also you must plan for when you do know you're going to be out to make sure that you have people who are aware of situations . Uh , when I have , uh , been sick , I have made sure I had backup lesson plans , but when I had planned to be out due to other demands , I made sure that I had everything very organized . I had communicated with my leaders as to why I was going to be out , the importance of it . Um , what steps I had taken to cover for my work absence , how I had communicated with students and already relate to them what things would be happening while I was absent , what expectations I had that would be going on . Um , having all this information and having extra work in place made everything run very smoothly . Um , communicating in documents that was very clear . Showing those documents to others and asking if anything is unclear and addressing that to make sure that the people who were filling in for you have no questions . When you get back , you're able to have a much more orderly environment . Uh , it is more pleasant . The , uh , people are able to tell you what was accomplished , what was not accomplished and why . And everyone is on the same page . I find that being prepared , having good people in place , communication in place is key to being able to basically have the needs met that you have outside of work and the needs inside of work being met .",4,4.75,4.333333333,4,3.666666667
142,P7gf5m4-5y7ua9,"We were , I should say my group and I , um , were assigned a project that had a timeframe of roughly eight weeks , uh , for various reasons after we initially submitted the proposal and work schedule that was moved to the left so that it was five weeks with a max of six to get everything done . So there was complete everything in five weeks and we have another week to finalize everything and submit . Um , so we had to then change our initial process . The primary changes were reevaluating what the priority drawings were and reevaluating how to associate , how to handle the various parts of the project to meet the new schedule . Um , as far as the rest of the group goes and myself , we also had to adjust the quality assurance process cause as we are creating our brain , the project was creating technical drawings . So while we can create them , you don't want to send them out without being verified . But when you're working on a tight schedule , the quality assurance can be challenging and is often the most challenging portion of the project . So we had to adjust that and have various people in the group prioritize QA over their own drawings . So it was a balancing project of balancing act of making sure drawings were getting done . They were getting checked and getting submitted for approval . But at the same point , we're staying on schedule and we're not creating unnecessary errors inside the project and drawings that are going to come back and bite us later . So once we set all that up , we've set about doing it . Um , we tried to stay flexible through the project as the best laid plans never work out , especially over a multi-week multi-month project . So we stay flexible and as priorities changed issues Rose , we communicated well and made sure that everyone was aware of what their responsibilities were to verify this . We also set up weekly telecons , which were open-ended . They would , we blocked off two hours , but sometimes they'd last 15 minutes , sometimes they'd last a full two hours depending on what people were struggling with or what people were dealing with . Um , at the end of it , we did submit the project , complete the project in time . Um , there was some hiccups as far as the approval process goes . At the very end , there was some minor miscommunications that had happened , but overall , given the accelerated timeline , uh , I think we , it was successful and we did a good job . Thank you .","The time that comes to mind when I had to add a project with hard to achieve goals . The one that comes to mind first is a relatively smaller project that I was working on where I was assigned to create a technical data package for a new CCA that was going to be implemented in some of our equipment . Um , the generally a CCA package consists of anywhere from four to seven drawings depending on how complicated it is . Um , this one was five drawings and I had seven days , seven working days to complete the whole project . Um , so I had to first to get the basic information or the supply information where I could create the drawings from the vendor basic information and then create a schedule realistic schedule , which is not always the easiest thing to do based off information . Um , and then lay out a process for completing the drawings and verifying the information is correct and then also submitting to the reviewer to make sure that the drawings meet the customer's needs . Um , so the first step was I said was to create a plan , laid out that plan and then submitted it as a verification to the customer to make sure they were okay with it . And then I followed through with it and prioritized the challenging drawings first because getting them into the review cycle first gives you more time to have other people verify them and then updating them is less work than creating them . So I completed the heritage drawings first and then work down from the easiest drawings and submitted them all and then stayed in communication constantly for the entire period with the review suicides , the customers review people to make sure that they were satisfied with what I was providing . Um , at the end of the day , at the end of the project , everything was submitted . It was on time and the hours were writing around the amount that they were willing to pay . Um , the project that I felt like I was success , that it was a couple of things that could have gone better . But given the evicts celebrated timeline , I thought that everything worked out pretty well and there was minimal rework due to confusion and other issues . So overall , I felt like I had done a good job . Thank you .","I'm making an important decision quickly based off of conflicting information . Uh , the , one of the , one of the instances that comes to mind is part of my job is to manage a lab that we work on . Um , I am the assistant and responsible for updating the servers and some other software updates that go into the lab . Various reasons it's not connected to the outside internet . So we have to do a manually , um , one of the , as I said , one of the members , I'm the assistant . So when the primary person is not around , I do it or I assist him if he needs help . Um , in this instance , the primary person was away for business purposes and I was there taking , um , updating the packages weekly . And one of the things that came up there was a , an issue that our security office had brought forward and I was to make , had to address the situation . Um , based off of my understanding of the system , we had a certain architecture inside the network in our inside our lab that did not require us to go through the process that they were talking about as our system is relatively simple . Um , unfortunately the company's security group had our system labeled as organized as in a different way . So they were looking for explanation from me about why I wasn't providing it or why it wasn't there . Um , as I said , my coworker who was in charge was not available . So I had to make a decision and explain my understanding of that , why we would be exempt or why we needed to start the process . Um , so I chose the answer that our system was exempt and try to create a paper explaining it and verifying why is there's an exempt . Uh , not my background is not it . So it's , my understanding was somewhat limited and not the best from a technical standpoint . But I did get the point across . Um , the security office was finished , like quite resistant to my statement . However , um , after I , we elevated it a little bit and I had the building supervisor come down and check out our system , he agreed with me . So it worked out in the end . Uh , there was actually the whole problem happened because there was some miscommunication on the , um , submittal of the last time we had upgraded collab . So they , we submitted the proper paperwork , but it wasn't float through the system . So there was a non , a beta portion which caused the confusion . So it worked out for the best . Thank you .","Um , a high pressure situation that comes to mind for me was when our group was hosting a set of foreign nationals to complete a project that we were jointly working on . Um , so part of the project was we were developing one side and another group from another country was developing another , the other , the rest of it . So we had a meeting where we were going to iron out all the interfaces and make sure everyone understood what their portion was and everything would work appropriately and correctly . Um , so the meeting was taking place and everything had to be finalized two weeks after . So the pressure came from the fact that everything had to be addressed during this meeting because once they left the timelines to figure anything out , we're not going to work . So if it wasn't fixed and addressed in this meeting , it wasn't going to get fixed and addressed prior to us finalizing the overall designs , um , to make sure that we met this deadline and did not miss anything . We had organized the meeting in such a way that there was group meeting , a large group meeting in the beginning . And then we would break into smaller groups where each subgroup would be talking more independently with the other smaller subgroups so that the detailed information would make sure that would be more , um , readily available and less distracting . Cause when you have groups of large people , sometimes it becomes hard to contain the conversation and things can go spiral out of control quite frankly , where you don't , aren't discussing what needs to be discussed and you get distracted . And when you combine that with a language barrier , it can slow the meetings down very , very fast , very badly and really derailed the overall productivity of the meeting . So we had decided to again break it into smaller groups where the stakeholders in each setting would talk individually and then you would reconvene at the end of the day and go over any major issues that may address others in the groups or cross group issues . So that organization seemed to work pretty well . Um , there was some hiccups . We ended up having to stay the last day longer because there was just a lot to get through and verify . Cause after a week of meetings and try to iron out designs , there was , you know , a fairly large list of issues that needed to be addressed . So we figured them out , got through it and proper planning and proper organization was key to making sure that the meeting was productive and did not ended up being a waste as far as there are higher ups feud . Thank you .","So the time that I experienced , difficult to keep in commitment was I had been assigned a project that was not directly from my customer , but then during this time I got a project , much higher priority project from my customer that was needed to be done right away . So I had to then go back to my supervisor and bring up the fact that I was no longer able to commit myself to the timeline that the company wanted me to do for this other outside project . Um , unfortunately there was no one inside the company that could take my place , so I still had to be responsible for it , but they were understanding as there was not the priority . So my commitments to them had to change where I was no longer going to be available daily . I was available twice weekly and tried to balance the customer's project with the company's project . Um , this regarded me to lay out my daily schedule more than I'm used to . Uh , and plan ahead and also staying in communication with my customer because the one benefit of the current project was once I was done , I had to submit it . And then during that downtime I would be able to work on the company's project . But it was a balancing act where you couldn't have either people , especially the customer , be aware of anything , any delays , because I was doing something else . But at the same time , the company was really looking for feedback on this one project . So it was stressful and I balanced it . But at the end , everything worked out . Um , there it was , it was challenging , but proper planning combined with proper communication , made sure everything worked out as well as it could have . Thank you .",3.333333333,3.5,3.333333333,3,3
143,Putvxvn-99gpji,"Uh , my role at my current position is , is quite , um , dynamic . I , uh , don't ever really feel like I do the same thing twice in one day . Um , I am currently , uh , acting as a , um , school principal and , uh , there was a time in which , uh , we had limited resources to manage , uh , the day to day needs of a large group of students specifically with , uh , behavioral issues . Um , and there were times in which I felt like I was running from one concern or problem or challenge with a student resolving that challenge and moving onto another one . Um , and really not having any time to , to debrief . So one of the ways in which we , which I addressed this was by , um , recruiting a few , uh , people to assist me . I didn't have an assistant principal at the time , but I did have a school counselor and a couple of , uh , support staff that weren't teaching full time . So what we did is designed a system to manage behavioral issues , both inside the classroom and outside , and came up with a systematic approach , uh , to address behaviors , um , in a , in a tier based system . So things that the teacher could handle , things that required it , administrative support on a , on a minor level , and things that required a major administrative support and the responsibilities were distributed accordingly .","One of the challenges that we've had recently at my school that I work at was , uh , we've noticed a decrease in , uh , academic success for some of our students . Uh , we have a end of year state level testing that we do with all of our students . Uh , COBIT has kind of thrown us for a loop in the sense that we don't really have as much , uh , instructional time that we can utilize in order to get these students prepared and ready for those tests . Um , one of our main goals , uh , end of the last year and beginning of this year was to design , um , uh , an intervention system to meet individual needs of students , uh , to help them either , uh , get to grade level with their academic achievement , um , or move them in a , in a positive direction . Covitz set a lot of students back were , uh , really there , there are a number of students that haven't really had a traditional classroom , a full year classroom experience for the last two , two and a half years . So , um , what we , uh , what we decided to do is revamp our , um , instructional practices to focus on data driven strategies to adjust and modify instruction in order to meet individual student needs . And the way in which we do that is we , we have a weekly , um , professional collaborative meeting with , uh , teams where they get together and , uh , collect and analyze data , um , achievement data , uh , throughout the school year . And that's done with support staff and administrators as , as kind of a , um , a collaborative team effort . And what they do with that data is , um , design or adjust their , uh , scope and sequence . That's the curriculum that they're using , um , to either increase rigor or , or , um , increase , uh , instructional time or , or decrease depending on , on what need , uh , there is for that particular class . And then , uh , uh , reassess and reevaluate on a regular basis as well to make sure that they're meeting the needs of the students , but also meeting the needs of their , their curriculum requirements for the year .","I really enjoyed these questions . They , they pretty much describe my , my main job , uh , descriptions , uh , that , that occurs generally on a , on a daily , if not hourly basis , depending on what's going on . I , I manage a school that , um , has a total of about 550 students . Uh , we have , um , about 40 full time teachers and another 40 support staff with a few other peripherals on top of it . Um , one of the , uh , major aspects of my job is to , uh , ensure a student's safety . And that ties in with a behavior . So if there's a fight or if there's a , um , an , uh , an accusation , uh , student to student accusation , um , it requires investigations . Um , because we have a limited amount of time with these students . Some of those investigations , uh , are , it's required that we , we make some pretty quick decisions , uh , based on , on the amount of information that we have . Sometimes that's an abundant amount of information . Sometimes it's limited , uh , and sometimes it's , it's incorrect or , or misremembered . Um , consider , uh , trying to get information about , uh , a situation that happened 20 , 30 minutes prior with a bunch of first graders or second graders that , whose memories change on , on a minute to minute basis . Um , so it requires , uh , some , some , uh , shooting from the hip oftentimes or , or following gut . But basically the process is you gather as much information as possible and through your experience and intuition , you , you have to make some , some , uh , quick judgment calls to determine the validity of , of , uh , that data . Um , there are times in which adjustments can be made if you've , uh , you've made a decision that was , that was incorrect or additional information is brought forward later on . Um , but it , it is appropriate at sometimes to make those quick decisions and do the best with the information that you have and move forward with it .","Um , one of the , uh , primary responsibilities that I have is to , um , manage , uh , interactions , um , between , uh , teachers and parents . Sometimes that can get quite emotional . Um , especially if you've got a disagreement in philosophy between that , that parent and a teacher . Uh , I had one , uh , that's actually continuing , but it's , it's one that we have , uh , somewhat of a resolution , but it's , it's probably kinda , uh , rear its head in , in the near future . Um , I have a , a teacher that's quite traditional in the way that , that she , uh , uh , conducts her classroom . Um , it's , it's a little less , um , uh , nurturing and a lot more , uh , personal responsibility , uh , direct instruction versus , uh , interactive and engaging , uh , activities . That's not to say she's not a a skilled teacher . Um , but it's one that , that I recall having quite a few of when I was going through school . Um , but the , the , uh , the trend in education is , is making a shift to a more interactive and discovery based , uh , approach in classrooms . Uh , but I do still have a number of , of teachers or parents that are very interested in , in a more traditional setting . There's this , a student in her class who , uh , spends a great deal of time distracted and frustrated . And one of the things that a parent has brought up recently is that this particular student doesn't feel comfortable or safe in , in this class . Uh , there've been a couple of incidences where , um , parent has felt like the teacher has been , uh , calling out this student for misbehavior in a way that was more public and less private . Um , and there's , there's some negative feelings on the part of the , the student , uh , to return to this class . So in , in similar situations and we , we've done , uh , or I've done pretty much the same thing and this one is , is organize a meeting between the teacher and the parent , uh , to try and resolve concerns , uh , with me kind of playing the role of a , um , a mediator . Uh , it's , it's important for me , uh , for me to , to facilitate that discussion and kind of be that , uh , bridging of , of the two . Um , the two personalities or understandings and acknowledging and recognizing that we're all working for the betterment or the improvement of the , of the student , and that we're all there because we care about that particular student .","My responsibilities in my position , uh , I , I would describe , um , that I can organize into , into three different categories . There's , there's the things that don't require any immediate attention , um , uh , uh , budgets and , and analyzing data and those kinds of things . Uh , that I can do kind of at a , if I have , um , some free time , there's other responsibilities that require some kind of direct action , um , but not on a , a , a minute to minute basis , but something that needs to be done on , on a , a semi , uh , uh , time constraint basis . There are other activities that require , uh , immediate attention where I'm dropping everything that I'm doing to take care of something that's more emergency based . Um , the difficulty is to find the balance between the three and obviously the ones that require that immediate attention . There's nothing that you can do about it . Um , but it does require , uh , somebody in my position to be able to manage , uh , the non-emergency , uh , responsibilities in a way that , um , I'm not putting off those , uh , less immediate needs . Uh , and then I'm using my time as effectively as I can . Uh , so the most effective way that I've been able to , uh , make that work is that , um , if I can redistribute some of those emergency needs , which is sometimes possible , depending on who , um , who's assisting me , uh , I can redistribute some of those immediate needs so that I can take care of the more intermediate needs or the , the less pressing needs . Um , I make sure that I block out time and organize my time effectively so that , that if I do find , um , a few minutes of downtime , that there's something that I have , uh , organized , that I can utilize my time effectively , even if it's , uh , just a few minutes here or there , depending on what else is going on .",3,3.75,3,3.666666667,3.333333333
144,Pgegqpz-g45enz,"So in my last job , uh , it was fairly common in my line of work for a lot of the personnel roles to be , uh , changed out rather frequently . Uh , and I worked in a team of about eight people . Um , and so I'd say , um , each year , maybe every other year there'd be at least one addition or one change within that team , uh , that would bring new skills and , um , you know , new challenges to each team that we worked on . Uh , and our job was such that , um , each person had a lot of autonomy , uh , on the team , in their own respective areas . And so when a new person would come in with a new personality and a new skill set , a new way of doing things , it really did change the team dynamic and the way that we work together . Um , and so I'd say , um , specifically two years ago we added , uh , we , we lost one person and added three new people to our team . And that was probably the biggest change that we experienced . Um , a lot of the reason we wanted that change was to be able to grow in different opportunities within our work . Um , and so I had to learn one how to work , um , well with a different group of people that I'd worked with before , you know , learning those people's personalities and their work styles , their organizational styles . Um , but two I had to , you know , form relationships with them . Uh , I worked in a , in a field where we , uh , worked together a lot with our customers a lot . Um , and so , you know , our kind of team unity , our cohesion as a group was really important to our work . And so I'd say both at a work level and at a personal level , it was important that we adapted , um , an informed those relationships quickly and will , um , to be able to help our work . Uh , and I'd say it went very well . Uh , I , I think I'm a fairly easy going person when it comes to , um , you know , being relational with people . Um , and I think we were able to build those bonds , um , and move forward in a way that helped our team achieve our goals more efficiently and more effectively .","Yeah , I remember specifically a time , um , not too long ago , about a year ago where I had to plan a golf tournament fundraiser for my work . And that was a big challenge . I'd say . Um , typically , uh , in my area , uh , we , we normally have a lot of volunteers that kind of help out with things like this . But I was in a transition period in my area . I still did have a little bit of help , some volunteers , uh , but far less help than I'm used to or most people are used to , uh , in that job role . Um , and so , uh , I wanted to set a few goals for the tournament . One , I wanted to raise at least a month , a month of our annual budget , uh , from in finances from that tournament . Uh , but I also wanted our tournament to be competitive with other tournaments in the sense that I knew in my community . Uh , there were a lot of golf tournaments that happened and I knew that people could , uh , when they left our golf tournament , I wanted them to either feel like I play in a lot of tournaments every year . And that was the best one I've played in , or I only have , or I can only afford to play one tournament per year . And so I want to make sure this is the one that I play in . And so those are some goals I had . Um , and the steps I took to reach them . Um , in raising the money , I kind of ruthlessly sought after , uh , corporate sponsorships , um , as well as , uh , you know , leveraging some personal relationships to help , uh , get foursomes to play in the tournament . Um , and then the ways that I tried to make our tournament better than our competitors tournaments was I tried to make really great prizes . Uh , and normally , and you know , I worked for a nonprofit and I knew that , um , a lot of people play in these nonprofit fundraisers to help out the organization , which was certainly a cause . And I wanted people to participate , uh , for that reason , but I wanted people to feel like they were getting their money's worth , knowing that our tournament , maybe it was a little bit more expensive . Um , and when they left , I wanted them to feel like they wanted to come play again . Um , and so I tried to get really great prizes for our tournament . So as I sought out those corporate sponsorships , I was also going to , uh , businesses and asking for , uh , prize donations and using our monetary donations , um , in a way that was efficient and effective so I could get great prices for the tournament . So I tried to make sure every golfer went home with something in their hands , something great where they went home and thought this was worth it . I'm glad I came to play . I had a great time , but also I got my money's worth . Um , and I believe it went well . We raised , um , just over our , uh , monthly budget . Again , our monthly budget was about , um , a little over 10,000 , and we raised just shy of $11,000 in our tournament and we got great feedback about the tournament and people that wanted to return the following year .","So , uh , the nonprofit that I mentioned before , I worked a lot with students and we would hold a lot of events with , um , you know , my minors that were , that were students , uh , in school . And , um , there was one time where we were having an event one night and , or had an event planned I should say , and a massive storm had come through our , um , come through our town , uh , and it was not quite a tornado but was a severe thunderstorm with very heavy winds . The ended up kind of really tearing down parts of our community . I mean , you know , trees are falling over , all that kind of , those kinds of things . And so this event was really important for us . It was kind of our , uh , big kickoff event , um , for , uh , one of our areas that , you know , we needed this event to go well , we needed , um , students show up and have a great time . And so I was forced to make the decision as the head over this area of do we still have the event knowing that , um , you know , it's an important event , we need it to go well and a lot of what we do going forward will build on this event . Uh , and if we cancel , uh , it'll kind of leave a sour taste in the mouth of a lot of students that we , uh , worked with . You know , cause a lot of kids prepared for this , uh , you know , we're really excited about it . And so it would have kind of really hurt our momentum if we would have canceled . Uh , but then obviously we had taken people's safety into consideration what parents were thinking about it and what the community would think about it , uh , and how we were doing what we were doing . So ultimately I didn't , uh , you know , this was a decision that I had to make in probably the hour leading up to the event . And we , we also were trying to , uh , figure out whatever decision we made , how we would communicate that quickly and effectively . So I ended up making the decision to cancel the event , unfortunately , which did hurt us a little bit . Um , but I figured in our work with students , uh , obviously primarily minors , um , that we thought their , their safety was our most important concern . And so , uh , that's how we tried to phrase the term community to the parents that we were trying to as best we could to care for the students and to make sure that they were safe . Um , and so it was a difficult decision to make . And a lot of our volunteers and other staff were upset with me , uh , cause they worked hard on the event . But ultimately I felt like , uh , the safety of our students was the most important thing .","So I think , um , one time that I remember being in a really high stress high pressure situation was , uh , about a year ago as I've been working , uh , had been working for this nonprofit , working with students . I was also in graduate school . Um , and so it hit kind of a a point like a cluster of this time where all of these kinds of deadlines came together at once where we had our major fundraiser , um , one night leading up to which took months and months of planning in advance in advance as well as our , you know , usual weekly events with uh , students . Uh , but then for my graduate school class , it was also nearing the end of my class . And so on the same night that our major fundraiser was , I had my final term paper due , um , that night at midnight . And so because of our normal events throughout the week , because I was working full time and going to school part time , I didn't have a ton of time to go to work on the paper throughout that week . And so it really did come to the end of that week , that weekend , me being very stressed , trying to make sure , you know , me trying to manage my time and make sure that I devoted the time that I needed to towards my job and making sure this fundraiser went well . Um , but also making sure that I finished this paper and did a good job on it , um , in school . And so how I responded , I , you know , I'm pretty organized . I tried to really schedule out my time , um , you know , a lot of deep breathing and kind of , you know , meditating , trying to get back to in the stressful situation , relaxing , not being so high strung about it . Um , and knowing that if I worked hard , I believe , I really did believe that I could get it all done . It was just going to be tough . Um , and so I ended up asking for help for some people on my team and that was helpful . And so I'd say , uh , it ended up working out well . Again , it was a stressful time . But , uh , that day I went and set up early for the fundraiser and then I had some people on my team come in the afternoon and I was able to get some work done on my paper . Uh , we had the event and the event went really great . Again . We raised about $30,000 at this event , and then , um , I went home and finished my paper and turned it in about an hour before it was due . Um , and so , again , high stress , um , time , but I think I was able to respond , uh , by effectively managing my time , uh , and getting organized with how I was gonna use that time .","Yeah , I would say that this is probably a fairly regular occurrence or was for this nonprofit that I worked for . Like I mentioned , I , uh , I worked a lot with students . Um , but I also had , you know , this full time job with a lot of administrative responsibilities , uh , responsibilities within the community . And so because of my , uh , you know , relationship with a lot of students , uh , there were a lot of times where I made commitments to them to , to show up to important things in their life , whether it be graduations or their athletic events or at their jobs and things like that . Um , and so if I had to pick one , uh , I would say again , last year noting that there was a group of kids that I was , uh , close to that they had their high school graduation for these kids . This graduation was a big deal and they asked me if I could be at the graduation , uh , to support them . And some of them didn't have their families there . Um , and again , it was one of these times in a work where we were getting ready for some big events coming up and there were a lot of , uh , you know , things going on that could have prevented me from going to this graduation . Um , and I'll say it was a lot of things that were happening during the day . Both things that didn't necessarily conflict with that time , but were making me really busy that week to make me think , should I , you know , should I not do this so that I can have some time to rest or to be with my family . Um , or , uh , but then there were also some opportunities that came up . Uh , some meetings that came up in that time that I knew were important . Uh , but ultimately I knew that I made a commitment to these students , uh , that I , I told them I would be there and I knew how important it was to them and I knew ultimately that I could do it . Um , and so I ended up being able to move some meetings around . Uh , and again , this was another stressful situation at work where I was a little pressed for time that week . Um , but I made a point to keep my commitments and show up there at the graduation as well as be able to get my work done that week .",3,3.333333333,3.333333333,3.666666667,3.333333333
145,Piiahh4-426viu,"In the past year , my lab had to move from our main campus over to a smaller research campus about 10 miles away . As part of this process , not only did I have to manage , uh , performing my experiments , uh , writing , uh , research papers and reading research papers , but I also had to help manage and coordinate the move from this larger campus to the smaller campus . The way that this was performed is that first we had to assess the new lab space and take time out of our day to go and plan out where everything was going to go next . We all had to , in between experiments , uh , we received boxes and had to pack up all of our items . And most , most of this was very sensitive lab equipment that we had to pack a very properly . The other thing that was difficult is that sometimes we would need to be packing something , but we would also need to be using that instrument for a particular experiment that day . So we had to coordinate with other , uh , the other people in the lab to make sure that we didn't pack something that needed to be used that day while also keeping in mind that we had a deadline to be ready to move by a certain time . So what we had to do is coordinate with everyone to make sure that we were not packing up necessary equipment and also making sure that everything was being labeled properly and being packed in a way that would not damage the equipment . We then also had to take time out of our busy lab schedule to be there . Uh , when the moving truck came and instruct the movers which boxes and which pieces of equipment were ours , we then had to go with them to the new campus and try and unpack everything while also trying to get started on our experiments in this new lab space , which was quite difficult .","When I first started in my lab , I was , uh , several months behind the other students who entered the PhD program . At the same time as me , this is because I had a lot of difficulty finding a lab that , uh , one I was interested in and to have the funds to take me on as a graduate student because of this , when I , uh , chose a lab , the other people in my same class had already performed this crucial , uh , presentation and milestone of , uh , performing what's called a qualifying examination . This , uh , qualifying examination is what allowed us to be , uh , to continue with the graduate program . And so I was several months , several months behind the others in performing this . So as soon as I chose my lab , I had to scramble a little bit to get it done before the deadline of October . Even though I had only joined the lab in September , the first thing I did was to politely ask the , uh , assessment director of the graduate program for an extension , uh , with the knowledge that I was aiming to complete this project before that extension deadline . And that is what happened . I had to work with my mentor to choose people who would be judging this examination . I had to very quickly come up with a fully fledged research project and had to research , write a proposal , and perform a presentation in order to pass this examination . So despite joining a lab in September , whereas most joined , there's in June , I was able to perform this examination , uh , only several months later in November , rather than , uh , back in the deadline of October . So there was only one month difference , uh , despite me joining a lab , uh , three or four months after everyone else had joined .","In our lab , we work with mice and in order to do so we have to go down into a special room and where a lot of protective equipment , um , so that the mice aren't getting sick from us and so we're reducing our exposure to the mice . Because of this , when you go down into the mouse room , you can't very easily contact other people or have them come and observe what you're doing . This caused some difficulty . When I went down to our mouse room to assess some mice that I had been using for an experiment , these mice , uh , were showing signs of , of responding to the treatment that we were using . However , there were several that looked to be not responding to the treatment and in addition looked like they may be sick . The reason that this was is because some of these mice were reflected with a genetic condition that results in their teeth not forming correctly . If not a address , these mice will eventually die . The situation in which I needed to make this quick decision was I was in the middle of , uh , deciding whether to continue treating these mice or to euthanize them and , uh , to euthanize them and stop the experiment prematurely . I was looking at these mice and believed that they may have this genetic condition that results in their teeth not forming properly . However , I'm not very skilled and identifying whether that is the case or not . So I had to call both my supervisor and my coworker to see if they could give me any advice . My supervisor said that if it was him , he would let the mice continue to live , but that ultimately the decision was up to me . My coworker indicated that if the mice did have this genetic condition , that these mice , uh , the data from these mice may not even be useful as this condition reduces the amount of food that these mice will take in , which can greatly affects the results of the experiment . Ultimately I had to choose based on my knowledge and my observations of these mice and I chose to euthanize them . And , and the experiment early , my , uh , my supervisor , uh , eventually agreed with my decision after I showed him the results of the experiment and showed him that the mice had been suffering from this genetic condition .","One aspect of our job at our lab that should always be taken seriously is the issue of contamination , particularly when it comes to our , uh , human and mouse cell cultures . Something that happened recently at lab is that , uh , one of our coworkers found that her cells had been contaminated with some sort of fungus . We then had to go look and assess all of our other cells that were pre , uh , that were cultured around the same time to see if they also had signs of this fungus , which is difficult because the fungus can be very slow growing . Additionally , we saw that some cell culture media that we were using had also been contaminated . This was very stressful as we didn't know exactly how many of our cell , uh , cells , uh , vials in storage had been contaminated . Nor did we know where the contamination had come from . I had to work with my supervisor and my coworker to identify the source of the contamination and I also had to work to address the situation as they had other things in the lab that they needed to address that were slightly higher priority . So I was very stressed in trying to figure out where this contamination was coming from and if so , how to deal with it . I eventually tracked down the source of the contamination to , uh , one of our vacuum flasks that takes up all of our waste cells and found out one of them didn't have enough bleach in it , and thus there were some , some fungus growing in it . This is not something that I like to deal with at all as I really , really do not like mold and fungus of any sort , but I had to suck it up and deal with my stress and anxiety and work to clean out all of this contamination and make sure that both of our cell culture hoods were completely free of these fungus for any sports . This was also stressful because I wasn't sure if our masks from Kobe were going to be able to fully protect me from this contamination . However , I was able to clean it up . And since then we have not had any issues with this contamination .","Recently at work , I received an email from a fellow student who was new to the program as he had just recently transferred along with his lab from a different university . The student wanted to know more about , uh , our institution and why to meet some more people . And as he had found my name being connected to this institution through LinkedIn , decided to reach out to me . I had , uh , indicated that I would be able to have lunch with this person on a particular day , uh , on campus . However , I later ran into an issue at work where I had to be working on this particular experiment much longer than it in a van anticipated . This happened sometimes as lab experiments can be very unpredictable and can often take much longer than anticipated . I ended up reaching out to this new student and informed him that unfortunately due to an experiment running much longer than anticipated , I wouldn't be able to meet him for lunch that day . He was very understanding and , uh , knew the nature of how scientific experiments go and we agreed to reschedule to another time . Thankfully I was able to meet with him several days later over lunch and give him an overview of how this institution works and answer all of his questions .",4,3,4.333333333,3,3
146,Pp2xm4k-8hsnt2,"Okay . Um , the time that I had to adapt to the challenge of my work is actually during the Kobe , the initial step of Covey that , uh , our land is closed down . Um , we have to work from home as a biologist . I need to do a lot of extra manual work without accessing to the family . Wellness is really a big challenge . What the way of under coop with this changing is that I started to work more of a theoretical project . I wrote , I wrote more killed , did Y analysis , and also fund collaborations with other people in the , now that I helped them and the most , their data in this way . I think my work as not delayed much by the impact of the Kobe by the lockdown . And I have , again , a lot of experiments and I've learned a lot about the toting and the fair pod .","Again , um , I'm going to refer back to the initial phase of the COBIT . By that time , I and my collaborator had a plan to submit our work of , of project by the summer of 2020 , which means we need to do a lot of , um , wrap up experiment to try the desert , the data for this experiment . Part of it , because of the covered , we lost the access to the land . All those experiments could not be there . So because of that , we really switched the gear from the experimental project to another fare Redco project that we adopt machine learning to analyze the data we acquired in the lab . So even if we felt meet our initial goal for that project , but we successfully started a new project and it will have a lot of data for that project in that way , I will not call that said this is a failure , but rather a pretty successful adaptation to this challenge . Yep . Okay .","Okay . I tend to think of such a situation in work , but I did have such experiments in life that is actually again in the beginning of the career , uh , the gender alternative . I was actually taking my , the occasion banking home in China and um , at that time America is about to set the travel ban for China . I was in debate whether should I stay in now , wait for the Kobe to sit down like sauce in 20 , all three which will take like fuel mouth for the wave to when Dell or should I go down to the U S immediately so that it will not affect my job if my plan ticket is in a was in a month later given all those clouds in China at that time and the information I have , the knowledge of all the self , I thought it might be not wise to wait because we really could not foresee the outcome . So I immediately changed my outfit and flew back to the U S before the travel ban was yeah . Option . And it turns out to be a very wise decision . That's as you can see , the commit is still out in the world nowadays , and if I didn't decide to come to the U S at that time , I probably would travel in China for , that's what has happened here and probably lost my job .","Yeah . Being a PhD student and a research assistant means you are having a lot of pressure almost all the time , but what's worse is the Covey that's prevented me to go to them for several months , which would have greatly impact the progress of my project and delayed my graduation . Um , at the initial of the Kobe lockdown , I was really panicked and stressed . Oh . But I told myself to come down and sing about what I could do during that situation , and then I realized , Okay , I have a background thing . Told him at this time I could start to code something or the whole now also for my own data . So I started some coding projects . I'm theoretical project , and it turns out it works well and the river will be published soon . So it turns out to be a very good outcome .","I in general don't have this kind of experience , but sometimes I have promised someone you might learn that I would going to analyze their data , you know , a few days . But Sunday I have some deadlines from my manager that I have to report it to him immediately because he had an important deadline . That happens a few times in this situation . I would first go to the person at heart , I promise to and then data , tell them the situation and ask them if a fault , propose an alternative that's and pull their data . They usually very understandable , alter the situation and allow me to work on the HyperAdapt things first and then their data . So I'm very thankful that like colleagues are pretty understanding about the situation and being very helpful in this situation .",3.333333333,3,2.666666667,3,2.333333333
147,Ptqzs2n-dp8ete,"I hate to come back to covert , but given what a huge , um , adaption it was to go from everything being in person to um , everything being online , I think it does describe things well . So , um , in my department I manage a group , um , that assists our organization with it . Um , and we had to move from everything pretty much being in person to everything , still working , still supporting everybody on the staff . Um , while everyone was going online . Um , we were able to take some of our equipment that we already had . Um , a lot of it was actually taken out of student labs since the students were no longer on campus anymore . Um , and we were able to repurpose a lot of the student lab equipment during that time for employees who needed work at home equipment . Um , and then my group was also able to start working at home . Um , we lost all of our help desk staff cause those were primarily students . So , um , my group had to step in including myself , um , to assist with help desk , uh , during that time . Um , additionally , we were able to eventually procure funds through the cares act , um , to procure more work at home equipment , um , for those that were not able to obtain , um , equipment through the labs . And it also helped because we were able to build , to , um , replace the lab equipment . Um , so that as we did start going back into in person , we still had lab equipment of Dalal for those students . Um , additionally , there was , I mean there was a lot that happened , but , um , those were two very big things that we had to adapt to very quickly , um , had to reallocate money , uh , reallocate all of our time and swap to things that we weren't necessarily used to doing . Um , I am proud of the hiring that I've done . I have an incredible team . Um , and they were all able to adapt very well as , as well as I was . Um , and we all worked together very well . Um , I brought them together that first day and told them what the plan was , told them what leadership had given us as a plan and where we could kind of be flexible . Um , and we all kind of worked together really well , um , to make sure that our organization was supported during that time .","So several years ago , uh , my CIO mentioned that he would like our , uh , governing body to move from strictly audio meetings to a V meeting . So audio and video similar to zoom . Um , but at the time the technology was more in its infancy . So , um , there weren't necessarily products capable of doing that as well as they do now . Um , one of them was Skype . So how do you make , at this point in time , um , Skype work with a huge room and a room full of mikes and five cameras and all this equipment and everybody's sitting in a big circle . So , um , the way that I was able to do that was I took the Skype technology , um , and then I linked up the room that we already had , which already had a lot of audio built in . Um , and then , um , we were able to basically plug in , um , a bunch of Mike's using , um , some inputs that we already had that went into the room . Um , and then we wanted to integrate video as well . So what we had to do was get a mixer that was built into a computer , um , purchase that equipment , and then add that in with , uh , the video piece , which was through Skype . Um , and then integrate that with the computer in the room , which I would then run . Um , and in the end , we were able to achieve that at a point in time where I think it wasn't as easy to achieve . And I think that the governing body thought it was really cool that we were able to do that , you know , eight years before everybody else . Um , and I mean , there were definitely those that were , um , less tech savvy and so less , um , willing to adopt it . Um , and so with those groups of people , um , I think the first thing that you have to do is build a rapport with them personally . So that's what I did there . Um , and then with that , um , I also got help from other members of the governing body who were more supportive , um , and they helped bring us together so that , um , we were able to make it a success .","I was put in a situation where , um , I was supporting both the governing body of the organization and , um , the leading member of the organization . And those are two different things . Uh , so imagine like a president and a governing board or something . Um , and so in this particular situation , um , the governing body was telling me to do one thing and , uh , the president was telling me to do another thing . So they were in very different camps , but both of them are obviously , um , Above me , uh , in terms of their authority . And therefore , uh , it's not easy to tell either of them . No . Um , in this particular situation , the governing body , um , assigns the president , so , so the governing body picks the president and then the president is actually under the board . So in this case , I knew that if the president asks me for something and the board says no , uh , I am not going to be able to do that . So in this situation I had to say no to , um , the president of the organization , not an easy task . Um , and there was not time for me to , because it was a one on one situation . Um , there wasn't time for me to go back and ask anyone . So what I told this person was that I did not believe that I would be capable of taking care of this or doing what they wanted . Um , and their personality was very , uh , difficult . So I knew that that was going to also be a difficult conversation , but we made it through . Um , and so after that , the first thing I did was to go back to my CIO and check in with him and say , Hey , um , just so you know , I was in this situation today , it was a conflicting situation where I had to make a decision . I do think that we would be able to , uh , do what was asked . And so I told the president that , um , I'm just letting you know , he said , yep , you did the right thing . Uh , then I went to go see general counsel , check in with Jen council and make sure that they were on the same page with me . Uh , they , they were , um , so it was the right decision , but it was a difficult one to make .","At the beginning of . Um , we all moved to remote work at the same time . Um , my three children in fifth , third and first grade were moved to remote learning . Um , trying to balance , um , your home life , your children , them going to school and you trying to get through everything that you have to do is extremely stressful . And I think any , uh , anyone who lived through that would agree . Anyone with children who tried to do remote learning would probably agree with me . Um , but the most important thing there was to establish , um , a lot of rules for how we worked at home . Um , a lot of rules for how we used our time and how that time was going to be spent each day . Um , activities that I could have them do , um , that did not require that much of me or my husband since we were both busy with work as well . Um , and then how we would respond if there was required parental intervention . Um , so I was able to come up with a very strict schedule , um , and then print out about a million different worksheets , uh , for each of my kids' grades . So that in the event that , um , remote school did not provide enough to keep them busy throughout the day , which I think you'll find it , it didn't always do that , um , that I still had something for them to do that was constructive while I was still to be in meetings and , you know , creating reports and working on , you know , getting everything together . So , um , the only way to cope with a high pressure , stressful situation , I think , um , is always to come up with a plan and try your best to execute it and keep working at it until you come up with something that works . Um , it , the first few days were rough . I'm not going to lie . They were rough . Um , but as we felt out the situation and got the hang of it , um , we found that there were certain things that definitely worked Okay . And so that was how we made it through . Um , and my kids are doing great now , so I , and you know , my job is doing well so .","I have always been the type of person who , whenever they are test with something , uh , says yes , I can get that done for you . Or , um , yes , let me come up with a plan for how to make that work . I think we can come up with something . Um , within the last few years , uh , my duties and the duties , uh , of things that are expected of me have just grown so , so , so much , um , to the point where it has become impossible for me to do them all by myself . Um , and one of the hardest things for me to do is to delegate , uh , things that I consider to be very dear to me . Um , and very important to me and very important to the institution , to other people . Um , luckily I have a wonderful staff and people that I know that I can trust that , um , provide a very high quality of professionalism . Um , so what I have been doing is basically training , um , two people from my group to start doing some of the duties that I currently do . Um , and I didn't do this , you know , in a vacuum or anything . Um , I had to go to my , uh , my boss and my bosses boss and my , his boss , his boss , um , and basically let them all know that this job was growing . Um , and , and that I felt honored that they entrusted me with so much . Um , but that I did need some support and that things were growing and they would continue to keep growing . So , um , my priority became a number one , making sure that the service that I provided and service and support that I provided to other people , um , was still very good so that they would retain their level of professionalism at the same time . Uh , my other priority is training these people to get to the point where if I'm gone , the world doesn't fall apart basically . So , um , that has been my priority and it's going rather well . Um , I was able to leave on a vacation two weeks ago , um , and nothing blew up . So I think it's , it's going rather well . Um , but it's been , it's been different .",4.333333333,3.5,3.333333333,3.666666667,4.333333333
148,Pdcqhjq-dmxcd7,"So I would have to say , um , one of the most interesting environments that I've ever worked in , uh , the truly most adventurous would have to be when I worked at , uh , the Fox fire museum and heritage center in mountain city , Georgia . Uh , they were a group of high school students and their English teacher who developed a , uh , magazine documenting Appalachian Folkways in the 1970s so they would interview members of the community going back to , you know , people who had living memories of the 19th or sorry , the 20th , 19th century . I'm sorry . Uh , so anyway , um , what happened was at the magazine got very popular . They made books , the books , I gave them enough money to build a museum where they transported Appalachian log cabins and uh , rebuilt them , uh , piece by piece . It developed into the heritage center . And it meant that I was working in living onsite at the bottom , or sorry , at the very top of , of Rocky Hill that had to be graded several times a season . And that required a lot of changes . You had to use less water . You could not walk into town . Um , I should have had four wheel drive on my vehicle . I didn't , which had been on my very first day . I had to learn how to gun it and take a sharp turn at the same time up loose gravelly Hill and a Kia Rio . So that took a lot of changes both professionally and personally , uh , to gear for that role . Uh , there was still an odd sense of work life balance , uh , despite living onsite , although I did learn how to kind of integrate what was my life with what the museum was and its mission . Uh , I tried my hand at a lot of different Appalachian folk ways . Um , and so I would say like that was a changing and complex environment for me . And at the same time , my job responsibilities were reacting to a changing and complex environment of being a small institution that wanted to digitize their collection , including , uh , thousands and thousands and thousands of 35 millimeter , uh , film rolls or negatives . And so I was helping them respond to the need to digitize these materials and , uh , sometimes antiquated equipment , but you could still make it work . It just took the willpower . So I hope that answers your questions .","So one of the most challenging goals of my life was to go back to school for my master's degree in art history . Uh , and at the end of that education you have to write a thesis . It was my first time ever writing a thesis because I , in bachelor school I was a fine arts major . So my thesis was an exhibition . Uh , so this is my first time writing a paper of this length and I had no clue how to truly develop a thesis . Uh , this was not really part of my English curriculum . I did take honors English classes , but at that time at thesis was no more than a slightly longer term paper . So it required obviously not , not days , not weeks , months of planning . Uh , starting my very first semester when I started to get an inkling of the idea , developing the rest of my curriculum so that I could continue researching it seamlessly and actually like develop it some . In that meantime , I decided what kind of direction I wanted to take because you have to do research for that at finding thesis members . It sounds like an end stage process , but it's not . It's also starts early in cultivating those relationships with people . Um , it was my first time getting so much feedback in the process of it was really influential for me . Um , and yeah , just having a team of people surrounding you that have a vested interest in what you were doing . Um , and realizing I think when you're working on something goal oriented like this , you have a common mission . You know , nobody's trying to beat you down here . Uh , and so I think realizing how to take something that seems like just an individual thing and make it a very collaborative environment , work . And again , the longterm always planning for that end stage . Um , I did complete my thesis in black and white , uh , Richmond on monument Avenue or something like that . Um , you can look it up on academia , I believe , but yeah , I think again , it just , it started the very beginning research for the research began with your research , uh , develop your team , uh , establish a common mission , set a deadline check in frequently were all things that helped me to complete my thesis .","So for me it all comes down to the research and actually developing wisdom or the knowledge should that research of how to assess . Um , and I would have to say , uh , I think I , you would come into contact with this sometimes in an archive because I , again , when I was working at FOXFIRE , we were digitalizing 35 millimeter archives or 35 millimeter film archives . And we came across , tucked into one of the research folders , some negatives , some not quite four by fives , but some older negatives . And I had actually done research again a years but will not research . I was in a workshop years before for digitization for smaller institutions and uh , it included a , another one after that that I attended was um , like how to archive family collections responsibly and the big tenant that came away from that for me , um , because I work with photography , I work with photographs a lot at work with negatives . A lot was if the film is possibly older than the 1950s , you need to make sure that it is safety film and not nitrate film . So what happens in the archive ? We come across some film and I know enough to know that I don't know enough and I know that it's a very serious fire hazard . It's a danger to , again , the archive to the institution , to the whole area because it is a rural area surrounded by trees . If there is a fire that no one can put out , that's going to be a problem . So I'm holding this in my hands thinking this can't stay here . It's , it's in a log cabin , a very dry environment , um , at the top of a Hill . And it's just , it's too much of a risk to keep it here not knowing what it is . So we go to , uh , the first curator , the lower curator , tell her what's happening , go to the head curator , tell him what's happening , tell him , uh , where we can find information on how to identify nitrate film . And again , we kind of all work together . One of us is saying like , well , I'm 100% certain that this is not nitrate . And the other person was saying , well , I don't know . Um , and in that case , what we ended up doing was contacting another archive , a university archive , and working with their lead archivist to determine , is this acetate or is this nitrate ? Unfortunately , we did eventually find out that it was nitrate . It was removed from the institution . It was put into what wasn't , uh , destroyed , was put into cold storage , uh , developed for nitrate film . And we , we succeeded . We got to keep those important photographs without endangering anyone .","So at the end of graduate school , I am completing my thesis , I'm completing my courses . I'm trying to prepare for what comes next at trying to make sure that I actually will graduate on time . And there hasn't been some grave error that no one has caught until now . You know , the way you do , uh , when you're anxious . And , and at the same time , I had been going through this curatorial studies course , uh , that included developing , um , uh , exhibition proposal and then submitting it to the institution to see it just in case you wanted to throw your hat in the ring . And so , uh , we develop it , that's essential . And then I decide to not only hand it over to someone with an actual , uh , space that could exhibit it , but , uh , again , offer to , to put it on myself . And it was accepted , which meant that in my final semester , on top of all of that , I was also putting together my very first , uh , collaborative , uh , curatorial experience before it was just a single show for me , you know , pretty easy . But this involved three other living photographers and the work of one dead photographer , um , with this institution that I admired very much , and I did not want to let them down . I knew the curators pretty well by that point , after , you know , just getting in the door , the hand them this thing . And so I again , I came down to research and wisdom and keeping people in the loop , uh , close collaboration , uh , constant communication about issues . And I , I think the true breaking , not the breaking moment , the too true aha moment was the first time I realized that I couldn't do something by myself . I couldn't do it alone . It actually did require other people to be there and to assist and to , uh , you know , to guide because we were having printing issues . We were , uh , blowing up and exhibiting some of these glass lantern slides . Um , and I thought something was a fair print quality , but I thought that because I had been doing it until incredibly late at night all alone . Um , you know , these like longer shifts and uh , when they said no , this , this print is not , is not good enough , we need to get it clear . We need to adjust these balances and stuff . I think that was the moment I realized like , okay , I can't do this alone . I do need a second pair of eyes . I could put in the grunt work . I could put in the labor , I could stay in the studio , but I need to communicate with other people . Um , and we need to come to a consensus . And it worked out . We got the show on , everything went off great . We ha we were , uh , breaking the capacity of , of the exhibition space . Um , it was printed in paper , so like , it all worked out okay in the end . But again , it all came down to communication .","Oh , this one is easy because I am a true stickler to deadlines . I always have been , uh , meeting deadlines was incredibly important to my father because he worked in a print studio , um , and throughout his life . And , uh , the first time I had multiple conflicting deadlines and I knew that something was going to go , I had remembered , you know , this kind of old saying , um , the thing that's been going around for a while I guess is a better way of saying it , uh , that you should treat the priorities in your life like juggling balls and some of them are going to be rubber and some of them are going to be blast . And the important thing when you're dealing with all of these conflicting priorities is find out what's glass and don't drop it . So , uh , again , it really meant that I had to put things into a hierarchy and I had to consider how much time each was going to take to develop and all of that and it at birth , you know , again , it was fine . What happened was , uh , one deadline was not going to be met . I had different priorities in terms of what had to be done . Number one was whatever got me across the Island graduation . Um , and number two was pretty much everything else . So there was one class that I was taking as an elective , just kind of as a filler . I did find it interesting . I was committed to it . I did love it . Uh , but I realized that if anything could drop that could be it . But again , I do not give up . I wasn't going to not turn the sentence . So again , I contacted him , uh , very much prior to the deadline . I told him what was happening . I was asked if I could have an extension . I low balled it to like , you know , what is the one that I know I could get it done by the very closest I pitched it to him . It was no problem . He like , and I realized this too as a teaching assistant is sometimes the things that you think are our mountains , you know , our molehills and we really appreciate it just when people were in communication with us and brought things to our attention early . And that is exactly what I did when I was talking to him . Um , and so it was fine . It was fine to get that extension , but again , it all came down to , you know , respect and communication . You have to be respectful of who's on the other end of this agreement that you have made , uh , end of their time . And so that , and again , the hierarchy , having your priorities , determining what is rubber and what is the last , uh , all of these things came into play when I had to , uh , unfortunately , kind of tiny break , one commitment , but only to replace it with another . So it was more like a bandaid . So , uh , I'll consider it a win .",3.333333333,3.333333333,4,3,2.666666667
149,P7rx3u3-gywkbp,"So one time that I had to adapt to a changing environment was an actual physical change to a work environment . We were actually undergoing a corporate renovation at our headquarters and everything around us was physically changing , uh , as well as teams were working on changing our brand , changing our culture , changing everything about how we work . And so everything around us was literally changing day from day to day . And so as a project manager for that , uh , process , I had to work with not only the construction company and the architect to manage the design and the changes and the construction process that was occurring , but also then take all of that and communicated to all of our employees so that they understood what was happening , when , what they could expect coming up the next week , the following several weeks next month , uh , so that they can be better prepared , um , for , for the work that they had to do and still complete . So we had people working on site , uh , and as the building was being renovated are all around us . And so we had to take , um , a certain precautions so that people could still be effective and efficient at work and still focus and connect with customers and do all the things that they needed to do and not be , um , distracted or , um , have the , the physical construction around them , um , have a negative effect on their overall work . And so a lot of the , the biggest , the biggest component that I found to be successful was actually communication and using that as a way to share anything and everything that we could get our hands on and get it , uh , and be as transparent as possible and get it back in front of all the different employees so that they understood , uh , you know , Hey , um , uh , Friday , this week we're going to have some loud , loud work taking place . Uh , they're going to be shooting a metal studs into concrete and you'll hear what sounds like gunshots , but it's not anything dangerous . It's actually a certain type of equipment that needs to be used and so on and so forth . And so giving them , giving those employees those types of examples , help them to understand what to expect and then they could make changes based on , well , maybe I need to work somewhere else in the building , and perhaps I could just work from home that day if it was going to be excessively loud , uh , than normal . So , um , a lot of what we did was just trying to adapt that physical changing environment and be as communicative as , as much as we could with as much information that we had so that everyone had all the necessary information at their fingertips . So I think overall that would be probably the , the most , uh , the time that I had to adapt the most to a change in your complex environment was just helping everyone to be better prepared for what was to come for this new project .","So time where we set goals for a project that were very hard or difficult to achieve was when we were working on our corporate headquarters renovation . And we were trying to define a specific schedule of activities and , uh , uh , uh , construction activities that were going to take place over several months and try to align that with different communication , uh , processes , but also , uh , just internal work , uh , schedules as well . And so one of the more difficult things was when we started the PRI , the project , it was a late fall and in the month of October , we had out of 31 days , 17 of those days , it rained all day . And of course we were working on a site that had clay . And so clay and water don't like each other . And we quickly found ourselves to be , uh , not underwater , but we had some flooding issues and we had areas of standing water . And it , it , it created , uh , it quickly . Uh , we quickly became behind schedule because of , uh , all of that , um , unpredictable weather related issues . And so working through that , we just found that we had to , uh , work times . We , we brought in extra crews , we , we worked weekends . Uh , we did things as much as we could , uh , given the , the status of the weather . But then once we got beyond that , we were able to actually do more , further , faster , uh , and , and speed up a little bit to catch up to our original scheduling . So it was hard in the beginning because we could quickly , we're , we're behind on the schedule , but with how we had things planned , we found different ways to make things more efficient . And if we had planned certain activities or certain processes , we're going to take , for example , three to four weeks . We found ways to streamline it so that I got it down to maybe two weeks . And so it would save us two weeks in that timeframe and then we could reallocate that time to something else . So finding way and , you know , being um , uh , you know , taking a proactive approach to looking at the full aspect or the full scope of the project . And of course this is , this was not the first time we had done something like this before . We had not done a full corporate renovation , but we had renovated showrooms and different buildings and different sites . And so we knew what to expect . We knew which activities needed to take place , but having all of those and we were able to bake , we call it bake , bake , bake in some extra time with different activities . And so that allowed us to , um , uh , not get so far behind that we then were at the risk of being over budget or , uh , you know , running over time or impacting the business . Uh , which were really three things that we were all trying to avoid as we , uh , worked through this project .","So a situation that occurred that required a immediate or important decision quickly was , um , I'm going to reference the same construction project that , that we had , but it , um , in the middle of the winter we had an ice storm that occurred and it actually in high winds and we actually had a glass breakage in the building where showered down glass , uh , onto the floor . And we quickly had snow and ice inside of this part of our newly renovated spaces . And so we quickly discovered this and had to move very quickly to , um , uh , you know , resolve the problem , uh , and , and try to mitigate the amount of damage that was occurring from the weather . And , uh , and certainly trying to find a way to quickly clean up , um , the , the work area so that when the employees did come back in the psych course happened over the weekend . So we scrambled , uh , both , all day Saturday , Saturday night , all day Sunday , Sunday night in order to , uh , put in temporary walls or , or , uh , you know , fix the areas where the glass was broken out , get that , get the building sealed so that we had no more weather coming in , get all the glass cleaned up and have all of the , uh , the water that was coming into the building , uh , which thankfully was minimal . Get the ice , the snow , get all that cleaned up and uh , get the areas that he had impacted , resolved . Uh , and then test technology , make sure everything was still working , um , and had everything ready to go by 8:00 AM Monday morning . So basically it was all hands on deck . It was getting , uh , the appropriate companies and who dealt with , uh , emergency or weather related issues to help clean up . We had in it , we had our facilities group and we had , um , just a number of volunteers coming into , uh , clean up and just do whatever they could . Um , you know , with , with obviously limited time , limited resources , we just quickly , and they could flip the information and we didn't know to what extent things were damaged . We didn't know where are we going to have to replace all the carpet or the new furniture that we had brought in and we're going to have to replace that . What was the degree of , of damage with the technology ? Did it get wet ? Are we going to have to replace it ? Um , so those things that we had a lot of different conflicting reports and those who are giving us different information about , well , we're not sure about this , but , but this definitely needs to replace . And so , long story short , uh , we just quickly , uh , put together a task force to work through everything as quickly as possible , uh , dealt with what we needed to at a high priority elements and then found a way to get it cleaned up , ready to go so that everyone was able to come in and work . Uh , first thing , 8:00 AM on Monday morning .","So a high pressure or stressful situation that I encountered at work was several years ago when I was working with a , uh , an insurance company out of Fort Wayne , Indiana . And we were still in the , uh , I would call it the design development stage , helping them to , to understand and figure out how to design their new , their new building that they were building for their , for their organization . And so we had created a survey assessment that we had sent out to their organization to measure different levels of effectiveness , uh , different levels of satisfaction and had , uh , brought that data in and shared it back with the senior leadership and the CEO . And so we had done a lot of this work and , um , then taking their program of the number of people they had , the thing that they wanted to put into the space and how they wanted the space to work for them , we had to find a way to , to , uh , measure that up against the data , the reports that we had . So the , the high pressure , the stressful part of it was we realized quickly that they had originally had planned for two floors for , for their , their company and through all the data , through all the programming , we found out that those two floors were not going to be enough to give them everything that they needed . And they actually needed probably a third floor or maybe even a half of another floor . And so this was going to be more money . This was going to be something that the CEO had not anticipated and planned for . And so it was stressful for us because as a design consultant , we were , we were left with how do we , how do we approach this in a way where we're still as a trusted advisor , able to share and be transparent with this company and the CEO , but at the same time not let them feel as if we have done something to change this so that they don't feel like we're trying to sell them more services or , or whatnot . And so it was stressful because we were uncertain of how the , what the reaction would be . But we had the meeting , the client traveled up to our corporate headquarters , we sat them down and we , we reviewed everything with here's what we've done , here's what we've learned about your organization . Here's what we've been planning , however , giving all this , you know , we , we basically , uh , step-by-step unpackaged or unboxed the , the problem . And so that by the time we were done presenting , they quickly understood where we were going . We didn't have to , um , sort of be very blunt and it was very apparent that they needed more space . And so they actually received it quite well and were quite accepting of it . And actually at the end of the day , they decided that , yes , we need to do the right thing for our organization , for our people based on this , we will go ahead and plan for the , the amount of , the additional amount of space that we needed . So at the end , it wasn't as stressful as what we had thought , but in the early stages it was , it was quite a high pressure situation .","So one time , uh , this is the first example I had thought of it , but a time where I had difficulty keeping a commitment . It was a personal commitment to , uh , a a woman who I was seeing at the time and I was in a relationship with her and , um , and things were going well and with the amount of work that was happening at work for me at that time , I was having to work many long hours during the week and even on the weekends . And it became something where , um , the time I had that I could spend with her because it was becoming less and less . And there was some commitments that we had made early on before this project that I had committed myself to . And , uh , later on discovered that I really wasn't going to be able to meet those commitments with her . Um , was , was unfortunate and uh , it was , uh , very stressful because it became a , um , it became something that , it , it , it became something that , that caused tension between us . And yet I still had this obligation to my job . I was still required to do what I needed to do to fulfill my obligations at work , which for me at that time were , were very important . Something that I was putting all of my , my , my passion and time into . And so , um , it certainly was something that , um , it didn't help but these , uh , these circumstances , these commitments , um , were more social in nature . Um , you know , missing a friend's wedding , not being able to take a vacation that we had started to plan and prep for . So , um , the commitments were , I won't say minimal , but , but they , um , there was something that we could have rescheduled or perhaps done at a different time . So unfortunately , um , that relationship did not work out . Uh , that was sort of the start of the unraveling of that relationship . But , um , looking back , it , it gave me an opportunity to , uh , to try to , to balance both , uh , home and work life . And I just was so busy at the time with work and what we were doing at work that I realized , uh , you know , maybe this was a , a blessing in disguise that I could just , maybe I need to take a step back and just focused more energy now towards work so that I could get through this , this part of it . And then once this major project is complete , then perhaps my life would become more , more even , and I would have more autonomy to be able to , uh , pursue those personal relationships . And so that's what I ended up finding was that once the project was completed , um , I found , I , I was able to strike that balance and , uh , uh , was able to find a new relationship that actually was a much more impactful and meaningful . So overall , I think it was , uh , uh , something that was meant to be .",4.666666667,4,3.333333333,4,3.333333333
150,Pv3hnsj-5rzf5b,"I've had to adapt to a changing and complex environment all the time at work . Um , I've been same company for 11 years , but , uh , what I've , what I always say and I think my colleagues will agree is that , uh , the only constant is change and the environment is always changing . And there's a lot going on behind the scenes . And especially as a digital producer , there's a lot that I'm responsible for behind the scenes that people don't see people see like the front end of fuels to this beautiful website , but they don't see all I've been that goes behind , um , as we've gone through different redesigns as we've had to respond to things like breaking news and different things , um , evolving with the industry and , uh , you know , different , just different things happening in , uh , like locally and nationally and out in the world . Uh , we've constantly had to adapt . And so , um , it's , so , it's just been kind of going with the flow and , uh , and , and really working collaboratively , um , as a team , you know , I work with a small , uh , like work group and , um , as news breaks and as , um , as we see our , the response that we're getting from users and , um , and we work with our tools , we're able to , um , kind of brainstorm ways to get better , get more efficient , and , uh , as , as things change , as , as the news happens and , um , as kind of the industry evolves and the needs of our users evolve , um , that's when we really sit down and we , we look at what our users need and , um , and what we need as a team to deliver quality products to our users . And then , um , from there we've been able , we were able to take the necessary steps , you know , things like how we do a redesign and how we , how we , uh , work with tools , um , to make our jobs easier and make the site look better .","Yeah , I was a product manager for a couple of years , uh , in the mobile app space . And , uh , we were putting out , uh , a brand new sports app and , uh , we actually consolidating , uh , three separate sports apps into one large force that we had one for one of them football , um , baseball and hockey . Um , and so we were combining them all into one on compensate one . And so we set goals in terms of timeline and in terms of like when the app was going to be launched , a store store , um , you know , I was managing a group of people , you know , uh , working with the development team , working with marketing , sales , um , we had , uh , you know , marketing dollars that we wanted . Um , we had , uh , time goals for , for for time that we wanted the , um , different steps , like , you know , when we wanted the design to be done and when , um , we wanted like the , the , the development on and when , when it was going to be our cue QA time and launched the store and when we were going to have our marketing campaign . Um , and so it was just kind of like , that's when we , uh , as as a , as a team , as a team that was working on this app , we worked out within scrum and that was like super helpful . And , uh , with , uh , with w was friends , like we , we had like a daily scrum and we , we just kind of checked in every day with like where everybody was , uh , for the day , if they had any blockers or any needs . And then we did sprints . So , um , we set goals over a two week period and certain tasks , you know , we have like a larger task list and we broke those down into what the team could accomplish within a two week period . Um , and so breaking it down into , um , those chunks into those smaller chunks of like , uh , uh , you know , building an app takes months and months , right ? But , um , over a couple of weeks , uh , you know , we can really focus on whether it was design or , um , certain functionality or certain tool sets or getting articles in or , uh , certain feeds working . So , um , that and putting that in really works , works really well . We worked much more efficiently as a team . Um , everyone was very clear on what , what they were doing , where we used Trello for like project management . And , um , I would say overall it was , uh , it was very successful . Um , we were able to , to accomplish , to put the app out in about six months or so . It was just like , it was an initial , uh , that was like an initial piece , uh , that was ready . And , um , over time we made adjustments . And , um , I would say it was pretty successful .","Yeah , I have to make important decisions quickly all the time . Um , it's part of a , it's just part of my job . Um , but one , one situation in particular , um , was , uh , I was working , uh , by myself , uh , from home , uh , years ago . And , uh , there was a , like a major breaking news story and it was Congresswoman who was shot and , uh , we had to , and I had to kind of find I to find a story to work with and um , make sure we had the right sources and make sure we were putting information . I remember CNN , uh , send out an email alert saying that , uh , she had died , that Gabrielle Giffords had been shot and was killed . And I had to decide whether to decide whether we wanted to , we were doing the text alerts , I think at that time , at that point in time . Um , and I had to decide whether we wanted to send out this information and trust CNN , uh , that , that she had died or were going to hold back . And I decided to hold back . Um , because , um , while CNN was saying she was , that she had died , there were other sources that I was checking . I was looking to see what the AP was saying . I was looking to see what Reuters was saying and um , and a few other , I know it was like , uh , you know , on the phone with a couple of colleagues as well . Um , and I started to put a pull back and , um , you know , because if we're going to say yes , we had to say that immediately because we didn't want to be the last ones , but accuracy is more important . So , um , I made the decision to , um , to just to , uh , put the fact that she'd been shot on her website but not , um , not that she was dead cause I didn't trust that information and turned out to be a very smart decision and it turned to be the up be the right call . And , um , it was very proud day because , um , you know , in , in journalism , uh , being accurate as super important and have that integrity to do , to do the right thing . And , um , knowing that I trusted my gut and I did my due diligence to , to visit multiple sources , um , and that I was able to make a decision , uh , when I had to in a very quick period of time .","Yeah , we've been asked to , uh , send email alerts and um , uh , and as a , as a digital person , we've been asked to do a lot more recently . Um , and as we regularly respond to breaking news and have to make decisions quickly , um , we also have to deal with a lot of pressure and we also deal with like a lot of competition and a lot of like fitting in a lot of tasks to do a very sh as quickly as possible and getting everything is as accurate as possible . So , um , you know , we have the homepage to work with . We have , um , mobile app to send push alerts to and we also now are sending email alerts . So , um , when there's breaking news , like one person is responsible for doing all those things and beating out all the other news , like at least local , um , news outlets and sometimes national , certainly , uh , when it's a local story that has national appeal and something like CNN is going to want to pick it up or , or maybe the APO want to pick it up or , um , or another national or international alphabet . Um , it's up to us to really move , move quickly and deal with , um , deal with a lot of moving parts , um , and deal with things quickly . So , um , I think , yeah , we had a , a fire that happened locally and it was big . It was , it was like all over like national news and , um , dealing with , and then just like trying to get that information right and then trying to juggle , um , the pressure of getting that information out as quickly as possible , as accurately as possible , and to all of our different platforms . Um , and with , you know , this is , this is in a remote world and so we use Slack for communication and got editors and managers , uh , uh , sending Slack messages every five seconds , um , and you know , worried about and everyone's worried about like , or we're going to be , you know , um , NBC or the other , you know , our competitors and , um , making sure we had the accurate information . And , um , so yeah , I was on the keys , as I said , that time . And , um , my approach was just really to take it one step at a time . We had talked as a team about , um , prioritizing , you know , homepage first and then someone , we had someone else to do social and then , um , I was going to send the push , the mobile push alert and then the email alert . Um , but through the help of the team , um , and just me staying calm under pressure , um , because I was getting messages like that and there , there was someone else from a different team that was like , Hey , let's do a , a meeting for something that's non-urgent today . And so knowing what to ignore and knowing , um , just like kind of filtering through the noise and focusing on like what I had to do . Um , that was , and it turned out really well . Like I was able to stay calm or the pressure and were able to get everything out on all the platforms pretty quickly . I don't know if , remember if we were first on everything , but , um , everything was accurate and everything was , uh , went out quickly .","Yeah . So I had bought concert tickets , um , to a band called silver tide , other than not really around anymore , but , um , I really , they were doing a reunion show and it was a really excited and I had like , this was going to be my time on a Saturday night for myself , um , to go and do something fun . And , um , and even though this wasn't , you know , it was , it wasn't necessarily committing this to anyone else . Um , I was just going to go by myself cause I , I really want her to go . Um , I was asked to work 5:00 AM the next morning , uh , and I , um , and with , uh , with like a couple of days notice and I was really upset . And , um , you know , I ended up , uh , going over and , uh , going over to the TLA where this concert was happening in Philly . And , um , I ended up bumping into , um , actually the lead singer of the band . Uh , so was the day of the show , I think I remember correctly . And uh , it was like , Hey , I love your band . It was like Wallace wall is that you ? And I was like , um , you know , I love your band , but I can't , like I have to work at 5:00 AM next day . And I think this was also like daylight savings and , um , was having that day . So it was like an hour , like an hour earlier . Like it was kinda kind of almost like 4:00 AM instead of even five . Um , I was like , uh , I'd really like to go to the show , but I , you know , you guys aren't coming on until like 11 o'clock at night . Um , and I have to be up for work like four hours later . I just can't make it . And so he understood and you know , I only , you know , I sold the ticket for face value and um , and uh , it kinda sucked to tell , you know , cause I was able to meet the singer , um , and say , Hey , I'm sorry I can't , um , Mitch , uh , you know , I can't come to your show . Um , I want to sell my ticket . But he was , he was very cool , very understanding . And , um , it was definitely a longer , you know , I did my workshop . I think I slept really poorly anyway . Um , and , but I , you know , I had to work and that was the agreement that I had . Um , I had a really bad contract at the time , so where they could work could just change my schedule , uh , was very short notice . So , um , I missed the concert , but I did , I know I slept really poorly , but I , I did my shift and I entered my commitment to work . So that's how it went .",3.5,3.333333333,3.333333333,3,2.333333333
151,Pjtjiwi-fkgui3,"As a manager in a past position , I had to learn how to adapt pretty quickly to the work environment . Um , I dealt with a new environment that I typically wasn't , um , very aware of prior to this role . This involves a lot of busy seasons and slow seasons . So instead of a steady , constant workflow , which is what I was used to , um , a few months out of the year , it would be a lot busier than the other months . So it was something that I definitely had to learn how to adapt to . Um , this being said , I feel though as though I did a really good job adapting quickly , I learned how to manage my time very well . Um , and I helped the people that I managed with their time as well , and I learned how to , during my slow seasons , help myself prepare for the busy seasons , whether that was working ahead or organizing things . So when the busy season came , it was just one less thing to do and it really made a difference to help me , um , prosper in the busy seasons .","A time where we had to set goals for project . Um , I was a little bit more tricky . It was when a client came to us and they wanted a very short turnaround on a little more of a complex project . So the first steps I took was analyzing , um , everyone that I managed , what their strengths were . I had people who were good at per a people who were going to be people who are good at part C . So when dividing up this project and the tasks , I really focused on that because for those strengths , I know they can , um , have a quicker turnaround , um , because they're good at it compared to something that they might struggle with and take a little bit longer to figure out how to do correctly . Um , so with that being said , that was kind of the best way to lay a foundation to make sure the project was going to do well . Um , in the short amount of time that we had . My second approach to it was just having open communication with my team . If someone was struggling to complete the project , um , even though it was one of their strengths , something might come up or they might be just struggling with it , I informed them , um , to just speak up as soon as possible so someone else can help out if they're able to or I can step in and do things , um , to really help out the team and get us to hitting that goal when we needed to .","In one of my first positions , um , as an entry level employee , I was not in a managerial role . Um , I was just entry level . I had a project that I needed that I was assigned . Um , it was about a three month project and at the time I had two supervisors and this came from supervisor a who gave me the instructions and explained what needs to be done . And a few weeks in supervisor B took a look at the project and said I should tweak a few things , changed . Um , some of the instructions up and I continued on and then supervisor a week later looked and was confused why things had been changed . So this miscommunication between the supervisors , um , was definitely a conflicting situation , um , as if it were just polar opposite instructions . So how I handled that was scheduling a time to sit down with both of them and explaining kind of what each had said , um , and asking for just clear instructions cause it was not , we wanted to make sure we reached our deadline and it would take over the deadline for our client . So it was definitely , um , a hard situation as someone who was pretty new at the time and had to sit down with supervisors and just ask them to kind of all for all of us to be on the same page . Um , I was definitely intimidated , but it was just a miscommunication . Um , and we got it figured out pretty easily .","My senior year at university was during the Kobe pandemic . It was the , my last semester started , um , and it's Kovats so it was a stressful situation .

And this caused a lot of switching around curriculums and exams and homework assignments and things like that . However , when all of my classes were doing that , um , towards the end I actually had three midterms or three finals in one day and then through finals and the next day , so six finals in 48 hours . And it was a very stressful situation and I was graduating and I needed to make sure , um , I passed every exam with flying colors . Um , and it was definitely a stressful situation , but coping with it was just time management . I learned very quickly how to best manage my time for myself and my own study and learning habits . Um , I'm someone who can sit down for an hour , hour and a half , and just focus on one thing , but I will need a break . And I've learned kind of the best breaks , including physical activity , um , grabbing , making some sort of nutritional food , things like that . Not just sitting on my phone for half an hour and then going back to studying . So I learned a lot about myself and my habits at that time . Um , which was definitely beneficial going into the workforce .","So back to the situation . Um , the same company when I was an entry level employee with two supervisors , I had one supervisor , um , assigning a project , we'll say March 1st and it was doing a month . And I began working on that project when about a weekend . Um , my second supervisor came in and assigned me a project as well and asked if I could do it , if I could handle it . And I said yes and they gave me around the same deadline as the first project . However , when I began working on it , I realized the projects both consisted of much more than I anticipated . And that being said , I did not think I could complete both at the due date . So I took the one that I was working on first , which I agreed upon first . I focused on that . Um , and I immediately when I figured this out , reached out to the second supervisor letting them know that there was going to be , um , an issue meeting deadline . And I learned a lot as a supervisor now from my supervisors prior . Um , they were very understanding and they were appreciative of me coming up to them . Um , as soon as I knew and not waiting to the last minute , just sheepishly kind of back out and say , Oh , it's not ready . Um , so this way I got a second person , another set of hands to help me on the second project . And that led to me being able to meet both deadlines and commitments .",3.666666667,2.333333333,3,3.333333333,3
152,P433e7i-c93xze,"So while I truly do have many examples I could use of times I've had to adapt to a change in our complex work environment , I really want to speak about one of my more recent job roles . So within the last year and a half I made a transition somewhat between industries . I moved from a more research focused biomedical engineering role into a more industry focused mechanical engineering role , which was a fairly large shift for me experience-wise . And in doing this , I actually moved from like a smaller research lab into a much larger um , industry based pharmaceutical company and I moved into their maintenance department as a mechanical engineer . So I went from having a lot of experience in running complex equipment and testing small scale laboratory equipment to trying to increase the reliability of production equipment that I had never worked with before . So this was , you know , being a manufacturing facility , a very , very fast paced environment , productions running all the time . I'm in a new environment that I'm not super familiar with . So I really needed to kind of pivot and move from this very research focused mindset where I'm very comfortable into this new realm where I'm not super comfortable with the material I'm working with . And it's definitely much more high paced and much more collaborative in that you're working with a full team that needs to have your support at all times . So it really , what I started with that is like I need to become more comfortable with the environment . So I started meeting one-on-one with people within the department , with my manager , and really finding out what should I be trying to learn right now ? What are some key topics that you think I should be trying to learn ? And I really started digging into different maintenance topics and industry papers and anything I could get my hands on as far as reading material as well as talking to people to understand what is this new environment I'm in . From there I started shadowing some of the people within the department actually going out to our production lines , actually seeing what's going wrong , what things are happening and seeing how people currently fix them . And as I started getting more comfortable in that environment , my next step was to start really getting involved in the work . So I asked if I could join in on some projects , if I could start helping out . And I really felt that I started getting comfortable and really finding myself in this environment . And I went on to further work in that environment and actually move into some new roles where I was leading some projects and leading some cross functional teams and initiatives as the maintenance person . So I think outcome wise , it worked very well . I did become very comfortable in this new environment and games . Great skillsets .","So I am currently managing a project which involves a regulatory change for over the counter pharmaceuticals that must be implemented within the next 18 months . And as part of my current role , I took on the project to lead kind of the scoping of the initial project to determine what resources we're going to need so we can better plan . So it was kind of the pre project before the actual project and because of various delays with COBIT and other industry factors , which I'm sure everyone is aware of at the moment , there's kind of a rush to get this done so we could really get this project implemented . So what we wanted to do was we wanted to reach out to any of our contractors as well as any of our internal manufacturing sites that make product that fall within the scope of these regulatory changes . We want them to find out exactly what they're making that falls within the scope of the regulatory change , what their kind of current statuses with those products . Like have you implemented the change yet or are you going to face any issues implementing the change ? Do you need any support and what support do you need ? And as well as , um , kind of putting together a timeline of when can we implement these changes and who are key points of contact . So this is a lot of information we needed just to scope this project . And I put together a timeline that was pretty ambitious , only about six weeks to find all of the contacts I needed at each of the internal and external sites , you know , create the survey data , determine what the data we needed , send this out , work with each of these contacts to ensure that we get all the information we needed , bring it back and analyze it and then report it out . So a very ambitious timeline , like I said , six weeks also right before the U S holidays , Christmas , which I knew many people would be taking vacation for . So it was a very ambitious timeline , but I went into this with , was to be very open and upfront with the people I was working with . So I sat pretty regular meetings with the key stakeholders for this project to ensure that we were all aligned on what was happening and to work through problems when they arose . I made sure that I was very transparent with everyone I was talking to about the deadlines , why we had these deadlines while we were pushing so hard and I offered any support that I could give to help people . So for example , some people , you know , I sent the survey and they could send it back immediately . Some people didn't really understand what I was asking . So I was always open to jumping on calls to working with people and understanding , you know , what do they need help with ? What can I explain better ? You know , what can we show you ? And eventually we did . We did reach these goals . We always have a couple of stragglers , but we really worked with people individually to get all of this data in so we could appropriately scope this project . And so we could eventually determine what resources we need and get funding and get people so we could really implement this change .","One situation that I think is a very good example of this was when I was working in research and development and I was working as a more junior lab member . So I was setting up a test that I knew we had a tight deadline to finish and I was setting it up the Friday before a holiday weekend in the late spring , early summer . And as you could probably imagine there were not many people still at work , uh , on a Friday evening , the weekend before , a long weekend in late spring , early summer . So I was setting up this test and part of the protocol for the test was to set everything up to send my like initial data collection to the manager for the project to ensure that everything looked good and it was given the official okay to set the project up and to once that okay came in , I could hit the go button , the test could start running and then it could be left alone until the machinery was done running , which would be some time , a few days later at the end of the weekend . And I could come back in and move into the next step of the testing . So I'm being told by several people on the project that this absolutely has to start by 6:00 PM today . There's no way we're going to meet the project deadlines if we don't start and we need to get this test running . But I also know from previous experience with the testing as well as the protocols that we wrote and signed off or on the test that I cannot press the go button on this test unless I receive verbal approval or written approval from the project manager . So that was the situation . Getting a lot of pressure to start the test . Also have a lot of pressure and protocol saying do not start the test without written or verbal approval . So I get the test fully set up , I am ready , everything is ready to go and I am calling , I am emailing the project manager , I am calling and emailing people that work closely with the project manager . No one is answering their phone notice answering their email . I understand it's a holiday weekend , but I can not get in contact with anyone to get my verbal written approval to start this test . And I had a flight for my own holiday weekend leaving very , very quickly . So I knew I had pressure to override and press that go button . But what I ultimately decided was we signed off on a protocol . We told the client we were going to run part of this protocol and it is not my place to start a test without receiving that approval that we said we would get . So what I ended up doing was , um , I had everything ready aside from clicking go and I called and left the project manager a message and I said , everything's ready to click go . I have someone that's going to be in the office for another few hours . They can click the go button , I have to go catch my flight . You're going to need to call them . But if you give your approval , they will click out and we can sort this out . And it ended up being a few hours later , the project manager called that person . They clicked out and the test was still able to run . I'll be at a few hours late , but not a few days .","When I worked in research and development , I worked in a team of three junior engineering associates and we were primarily responsible for the bulk of the laboratory work that was being done at the facility . So our principal investigators , our PhDs , they were typically the ones that were interfacing with our internal and external clients . They were the ones that were designing the projects , the protocols and interfacing in that sense . But the team of us three were the ones that were executing the protocols and executing the work in the laboratory . And I will have to say a team of three was a little less than we probably needed for that . There were a solid 20 to 25 associates , um , senior associates that were bringing down project work . So it was stretched very thin of us three to be covering all of this . What happened was , um , it was , uh , one particular week during this job and we knew we were going to be stretched a little thin because one of the three associates was going on vacation totally fine . So I get into work Monday morning and I noticed the third associate , um , is not there . It's just me and I spoke to that associate and it found out that they had had a family emergency over the weekend and they were going to be out indefinitely as well . So we now have two weeks full project load and I'm the only junior associate . So what I did was I got all of the information I have because I'm not going to bother these people on their vacation and during their family emergency of what their products were . I went to all of the other associates I knew they worked for now that what the workload was there , took this list of their workload plus my workload to our office , leave the most senior person there . I didn't explain the situation . I'm like , I'm the only person here . This is what I have , this is how it's been prioritized fat or when I need you to sit down and help me prioritize this because I need to know what I need to work on . I can't physically do all of this work , but I will do as much as I can . So we prioritize . We're actually able to call in another resource , Paul , someone from another part of the company to come help for a few days . And we were able to keep the priority work moving ahead , and we were able to keep most of the other projects generally above water . I mean , obviously three people's work can not be done by one person consistently , but we were able to keep things steady enough so that when those two associates came back , we were able to roll back into our normal routine .","So while I was a junior engineering associate at a research and development farm , I was also completing my master's degree in engineering . So I was doing both at the same time and it was extremely , extremely difficult to prioritize both my my graduate degree in the workout is doing for that degree as well as my job roles . I was already working 50 or more hours a week in my current job and then I was also trying to complete my graduate work on top of that and I was having trouble keeping deadlines . I had set for my graduate work and the work I was doing to try like the lab work I was doing because I was focusing so much with my time on work . So I ended up having to meet with my advisor and really push through what , what my deadlines were and what I could reasonably do in order to keep my graduate work on a good timeline . So I had discussions with my advisor for my graduate work . I had discussions for my manager , with my manager at my actual job and we had to figure out where the balance could be . So what ultimately happened was we found that the scope of my graduate work was very , very ambitious and I didn't really need to be doing everything I had initially planned on doing in order to create a good project . And it was honestly going to be more succinct and I would be able to dive deeper into some of the material if I cut the scope a little bit . So the scope of my graduate work got cut so I could have a more focused , more streamlined thesis . And I was also able to get one of my projects at work , not offloaded , but we were able to bring in another person to aid me in one of my major projects at work . So I had a little more free time around my work priorities . And I think outcome wise , everything works very well . I did finish my graduate thesis on time . I did defend successfully and I did manage to keep myself from overworking and my job role and keeping my project work deadlines aligned very well .",4.333333333,4.333333333,3.666666667,3.666666667,3.333333333
